** Introduction
*** Background
The Tajik people came under Russian rule in the 1860s and 1870s, but Russia's hold on Central Asia weakened following the Revolution of 1917. Bands of indigenous guerrillas (called "basmachi") fiercely contested Bolshevik control of the area, which was not fully reestablished until 1925. Tajikistan was first created as an autonomous republic within Uzbekistan in 1924, but the USSR designated Tajikistan a separate republic in 1929 and transferred to it much of present-day Sughd province. Ethnic Uzbeks form a substantial minority in Tajikistan. Tajikistan became independent in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union, and experienced a civil war between regional factions from 1992 to 1997. Tajikistan endured several domestic security incidents during 2010-12, including armed conflict between government forces and local strongmen in the Rasht Valley and between government forces and criminal groups in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast. The country remains the poorest in the former Soviet sphere. Tajikistan became a member of the World Trade Organization in March 2013. However, its economy continues to face major challenges, including dependence on remittances from Tajikistanis working in Russia, pervasive corruption, and the major role narcotrafficking plays in the country's informal economy.

** Economy
*** Economy - overview
Tajikistan's economic situation remains fragile due to the uneven implementation of structural reforms, corruption, weak governance, seasonal power shortages, and its large external debt burden. Tajikistan has one of the lowest per capita GDPs among the 15 former Soviet republics. The 1992-97 civil war severely damaged an already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in industrial and agricultural production. Because of a lack of employment opportunities in Tajikistan, more than one million Tajik citizens work abroad - roughly 90% in Russia - supporting families back home through remittances that amount to nearly 50% of GDP. Less than 7% of the land area is arable and cotton is the most important crop. Tajikistan imports approximately 60% of its food, mostly by rail. Mineral resources include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry consists mainly of small obsolete factories in food processing and light industry, substantial hydropower facilities, and a large aluminum plant - currently operating well below its capacity. Some experts estimate the value of narcotics transiting Tajikistan is equivalent to 30-50% of GDP. Tajikistan has sought to develop its substantial hydroelectricity potential through partnership with Russian and Iranian investors. The government is pinning its drive for energy independence on completion of the Roghun dam, which will take at least 8 to 11 years to construct, according to a World Bank feasibility study that was published in July 2014. If built according to plan, Roghun would be the tallest dam in the world and would significantly expand Tajikistan’s electricity output. However, Uzbekistan opposes the project, which has damaged relations between the two countries. Uzbekistan closed one of the rail lines into Tajikistan in late 2011, hampering the transit of goods to and from the southern part of the country. As a result, food and fuel prices in Tajikistan have increased to the highest levels since 2002.
