Romania's macroeconomic gains have only recently started to spur creation of a middle class and to address Romania's widespread poverty. Corruption and red tape continue to permeate the business environment. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Romania signed on to a $26 billion emergency assistance package from the IMF, the EU, and other international lenders, but GDP contracted until 2011. In March 2011, Romania and the IMF/EU/World Bank signed a 24-month precautionary stand-by agreement, worth $6.6 billion, to promote fiscal discipline, encourage progress on structural reforms, and strengthen financial sector stability. In September 2013, Romanian authorities and the IMF/EU agreed to a follow-on precautionary two-year stand-by agreement, worth $5.4 billion, to continue with reforms, although Bucharest has announced that it does not intend to draw funds under the agreement. Economic growth rebounded in 2013, driven by strong industrial exports and an excellent agricultural harvest, and the current account deficit was reduced substantially. The economy closed out 2014 with 2.8% growth, down from the 3.5% posted in 2013. Industry outperformed other sectors of the economy. Exports remained the engine of economic growth, led by trade with the EU, which accounts for roughly 70% of Romania trade. In 2014, the Government of Romania succeeded in meeting its annual target for the budget deficit, the external deficit remained low, and inflation was the lowest since 1989, allowing a gradual loosening of the monetary policy throughout the year. However, progress on structural reforms has been uneven and the economy still is vulnerable to external shocks. An ageing population, weak domestic demand, tax evasion, and insufficient health-care represent the top vulnerabilities."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$31.71 billion (31 December 2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"55"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, chemicals, fuels and minerals, metals, textile and products, agricultural products"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"5.4%","industry":"27.3%","services":"67.3% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$129.3 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"43"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, metals and metal products, textiles and footwear, chemicals, agricultural products, minerals and fuels"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"14.5%","highest 10%":"7.7% (2013 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Black Sea 0 m","highest point":"Moldoveanu 2,544 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"46 00 N, 25 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"211.9 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"6.88  cu km/yr (22%/61%/17%)","per capita":"320.8  cu m/yr (2009)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"soil erosion and degradation;

they were de facto linked in 1859 and formally united in 1862 under the new name of Romania. The country gained recognition of its independence in 1878. It joined the Allied Powers in World War I and acquired new territories - most notably Transylvania - following the conflict. In 1940, Romania allied with the Axis powers and participated in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR. Three years later, overrun by the Soviets, Romania signed an armistice. The post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of a communist \"people's republic\" in 1947 and the abdication of the king. The decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU, who took power in 1965, and his Securitate police state became increasingly oppressive and draconian through the 1980s. CEAUSESCU was overthrown and executed in late 1989. Former communists dominated the government until 1996 when they were swept from power.
