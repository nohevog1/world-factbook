Cambodian GDP grew at an average annual rate of over 8% between 2000 and 2010 and over 7% since 2011.  The tourism, garment, construction and real estate, and agriculture sectors accounted for the bulk of growth.  Around 600,000 people, the majority of whom are women, are employed in the garment and footwear sector.  An additional 500,000 Cambodians are employed in the tourism sector, and a further 50,000 people in construction.  In 2005, exploitable oil deposits were found beneath Cambodia's territorial waters, representing a potential revenue stream for the government, if commercial extraction becomes feasible. Some of the deposits are located within the so-called overlapping claimed areas with Thailand.  However, an unresolved border dispute with Thailand has so far prevented development in those areas. Mining also is attracting some investor interest and the government has touted opportunities for mining bauxite, gold, iron and gems. The tourism industry has continued to grow rapidly with foreign arrivals exceeding 2 million per year since 2007 and reaching around 4.5 million visitors in 2014. Cambodia, nevertheless, remains one of the poorest countries in Asia and long-term economic development remains a daunting challenge, inhibited by endemic corruption, limited educational opportunities, high income inequality, and poor job prospects. As of 2012, approximately 2.66 million people live on less than $1.20 per day, and 37% of Cambodian children under the age of 5 suffer from chronic malnutrition. More than 50% of the population is less than 25 years old. The population lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the impoverished countryside, which also lacks basic infrastructure. The Cambodian Government has been working with bilateral and multilateral donors, including the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and IMF, to address the country's many pressing needs; more than 30% of the government budget comes from donor assistance. A major economic challenge for Cambodia over the next decade will be fashioning an economic environment in which the private sector can create enough jobs to handle Cambodia's demographic imbalance. Following the 2013 national elections, the government announced a variety of economic and business reforms. The government is also moving forward with new legislation to meet the 2015 deadline for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum products, cigarettes, gold, construction materials, machinery, motor vehicles, pharmaceutical products"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"32.7%","industry":"25.5%","services":"41.8% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$5.124 billion (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"116"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"clothing, timber, rubber, rice, fish, tobacco, footwear"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2%","highest 10%":"28% (2013 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Gulf of Thailand 0 m","highest point":"Phnum Aoral 1,810 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"13 00 N, 105 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"476.1 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"2.18  cu km/yr (4%/2%/94%)","per capita":"159.8  cu m/yr (2006)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"illegal logging activities throughout the country and strip mining for gems in the western region along the border with Thailand have resulted in habitat loss and declining biodiversity (in particular, destruction of mangrove swamps threatens natural fisheries);

UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government, but a second round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition government and renewed political stability. The remaining elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders have been tried or are awaiting trial for crimes against humanity by a hybrid UN-Cambodian tribunal supported by international assistance. Elections in July 2003 were relatively peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between contending political parties before a coalition government was formed. In October 2004, King Norodom SIHANOUK abdicated the throne and his son, Prince Norodom SIHAMONI, was selected to succeed him. The most recent local (Commune Council) elections were held in Cambodia in 2012, with little of the preelection violence that preceded prior elections. National elections in July 2013 were disputed, with the opposition - the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) - boycotting the National Assembly. The political impasse was ended nearly a year later, with the CNRP agreeing to enter parliament in exchange for ruling party commitments to electoral and legislative reforms."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"PHNOM PENH (capital) 1.731 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"31.43% (male 2,489,964/female 2,447,645)","15-24 years":"19.71% (male 1,532,016/female 1,564,240)","25-54 years":"39.61% (male 3,043,676/female 3,178,825)","55-64 years":"5.2% (male 315,741/female 501,544)","65 years and over":"4.04% (male 238,840/female 396,265) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"55.6%","youth dependency ratio":"49.2%","elderly dependency ratio":"6.4%","potential support ratio":"15.6% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"2,600 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"49"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.17 physicians/1,000 population (2012)"},"Languages":{"value":"Khmer (official) 96.3%, other 3.7% (2008 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 57.6% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"50.5% (2010/11)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"74,600 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"49"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-0.32 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"129"},"Religions":{"value":"Buddhist (official) 96.9%, Muslim 1.9%, Christian 0.4%, other 0.8% (2008 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"3.4%","male":"3.5%","female":"3.3% (2008 est.)","country comparison to the world":"130"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"7.5% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"127"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 24.5% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"2.9% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"183"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Cambodian(s)","adjective":"Cambodian"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Khmer 90%, Vietnamese 5%, Chinese 1%, other 4%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"0.7 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.02 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.98 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.96 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.63 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.6 male(s)/female","total population":"0.94 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"24.5 years","male":"23.8 years","female":"25.2 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"15,708,756","note":"estimates for this country take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"69"},"Birth rate":{"value":"23.83 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"61"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"2.6% of GDP (2010)","country comparison to the world":"152"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"29% (2011)","country comparison to the world":"18"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"1,345,269","percentage":"39% (2001 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"11 years","male":"12 years","female":"10 years (2008)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"77.2%","male":"84.5%","female":"70.5% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.6 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"75"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.64% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"59"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"64.14 years","male":"61.69 years","female":"66.7 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"180"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"50.04 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"56.69 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"43.11 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"36"},"Death rate":{"value":"7.68 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"108"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"20.7% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"2.65% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.58% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"76"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, and malaria","note":"highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been identified in this country; it poses a negligible risk with extremely rare cases possible among US citizens who have close contact with birds (2013)"}}}
