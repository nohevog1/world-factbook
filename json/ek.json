Declining revenue from hydrocarbon production, high levels of infrastructure expenditures, lack of economic diversification, and corruption have led to limited improvements in the general population’s living conditions.  Equatorial Guinea hosted two economic diversification symposia in 2014 that focused on attracting investment in five sectors: agriculture and animal ranching, fishing, mining and petrochemicals, tourism, and financial services. Undeveloped mineral resources include gold, zinc, diamonds, columbite-tantalite, and other base metals. Forestry and farming are also minor components of GDP. Subsistence farming is the dominant form of livelihood. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy since independence has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. Foreign assistance programs by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement and high GDP figures now make Equatorial Guinea ineligible for most donor assistance. The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues and has attempted to address this issue by working towards compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.  US foreign assistance to Equatorial Guinea is limited in part because of US restrictions pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum sector equipment, other equipment, construction materials, vehicles"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"5.1%","industry":"85.7%","services":"9.2% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$1.548 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"156"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum products, timber"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Pico Basile 3,008 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"2 00 N, 10 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"26 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.02  cu km/yr (80%/15%/5%)","per capita":"31.41  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"tap water is non-potable;

it is one of the smallest countries in Africa consisting of a mainland territory and five inhabited islands. The capital of Malabo is located on the island of Bioko, approximately 25 km from the Cameroonian coastline in the Gulf of Guinea. Between 1968 and 1979, autocratic President Francisco MACIAS NGUEMA virtually destroyed all of the country's political, economic, and social institutions before being deposed by his nephew Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO in a coup. President OBIANG has ruled since October 1979 and plans to stand for reelection in 2016. Although nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, presidential and legislative elections between 1996 and 2009 were widely seen as flawed. The president exerts almost total control over the political system and has placed legal and bureaucratic barriers that prevent political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves, and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall from oil production, resulting in a massive increase in government revenue in recent years, the drop in global oil prices has placed significant strain on the state budget. Equatorial Guinea continues to seek to diversify its economy and to increase foreign investment despite limited improvements in the population's living standards. Equatorial Guinea is the host of major regional and international conferences and continues to seek a greater role in regional affairs."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"MALABO (capital) 145,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"40.47% (male 152,305/female 147,454)","15-24 years":"19.55% (male 73,728/female 71,086)","25-54 years":"31.74% (male 116,937/female 118,148)","55-64 years":"4.24% (male 13,519/female 17,884)","65 years and over":"4.01% (male 12,462/female 17,220) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"72.9%","youth dependency ratio":"67.9%","elderly dependency ratio":"5%","potential support ratio":"20% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"800 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"71"},"Languages":{"value":"Spanish (official) 67.6%, other (includes French (official), Fang, Bubi) 32.4% (1994 census)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 25.5% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"12.6% (2011)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"31,600 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"70"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"99"},"Religions":{"value":"nominally Christian and predominantly Roman Catholic, pagan practices"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"3.5% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"149"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 52.1% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"16.2% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"129"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Equatorial Guinean(s) or Equatoguinean(s)","adjective":"Equatorial Guinean or Equatoguinean"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Fang 85.7%, Bubi 6.5%, Mdowe 3.6%, Annobon 1.6%, Bujeba 1.1%, other 1.4% (1994 census)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"2.1 beds/1,000 population (2010)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.99 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.76 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.72 male(s)/female","total population":"0.99 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"19.5 years","male":"19 years","female":"20 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"740,743 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"166"},"Birth rate":{"value":"33.31 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"32"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"5.6% (2010)","country comparison to the world":"87"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"35,382","percentage":"28% (2000 est.)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"95.3%","male":"97.4%","female":"93% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"4.57 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"24"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"6.16% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"11"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"63.85 years","male":"62.76 years","female":"64.97 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"183"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"69.17 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"70.21 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"68.09 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"14"},"Death rate":{"value":"8.19 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"89"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"39.9% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"3.12% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"2.51% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"23"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne disease":"malaria and dengue fever","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
