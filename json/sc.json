Following the 2005 harvest, the government closed the sugar industry after several decades of losses. To compensate for lost jobs, the government has embarked on a program to diversify the agricultural sector and to stimulate other sectors of the economy, such as export-oriented manufacturing and offshore banking. Roughly 200,000 tourists visited the islands in 2009, but reduced tourism arrivals and foreign investment led to an economic contraction in 2009-2013, and the economy returned to growth only in 2014. Like other tourist destinations in the Caribbean, St. Kitts and Nevis is vulnerable to damage from natural disasters and shifts in tourism demand. The government has made notable progress on reducing its public debt, from 154% of GDP in 2011 to 83% in 2013, although it still faces one of the highest levels in the world, largely attributable to public enterprise losses."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$623.9 million (31 December 2010)","country comparison to the world":"112"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery, manufactures, food, fuels"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"1.5%","industry":"23%","services":"75.4% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$158.7 million (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"189"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"machinery, food, electronics, beverages, tobacco"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Mount Liamuiga 1,156 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"17 20 N, 62 45 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"0.02 cu km (2011)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"NA"},"Location":{"value":"Caribbean, islands in the Caribbean Sea, about one-third of the way from Puerto Rico to Trinidad and Tobago"},"Geography - note":{"value":"smallest country in the Americas and Western Hemisphere;
