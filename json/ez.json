The auto industry is the largest single industry, and, together with its upstream suppliers, accounts for nearly 24% of Czech manufacturing. The Czech Republic produced more than a million cars for the first time in 2010, over 80% of which were exported. While the conservative, inward-looking Czech financial system has remained relatively healthy, the small, open, export-driven Czech economy remains sensitive to changes in the economic performance of its main export markets, especially Germany. When Western Europe and Germany fell into recession in late 2008, demand for Czech goods plunged, leading to double digit drops in industrial production and exports. As a result, real GDP fell sharply in 2009. The economy slowly recovered in the second half of 2009 and registered weak growth in the next two years. In 2012 and 2013, however, the economy fell into a recession again, due both to a slump in external demand in the EU and to the governmentâ€™s austerity measures, returning to weak growth in 2014. Foreign and domestic businesses alike voice concerns about corruption, especially in public procurement. Other long term challenges include dealing with a rapidly aging population, funding an unsustainable pension and health care system, and diversifying away from manufacturing and toward a more high-tech, services-based, knowledge economy."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$53.2 billion (30 December 2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"51"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and transport equipment, raw materials and fuels, chemicals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"2.6%","industry":"37.4%","services":"60% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$114.3 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"44"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and transport equipment, raw materials, fuel, chemicals"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"1.5%","highest 10%":"29.1% (2012 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Labe (Elbe) River 115 m","highest point":"Snezka 1,602 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"49 45 N, 15 30 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"13.15 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"1.7  cu km/yr (41%/56%/2%)","per capita":"164.7  cu m/yr (2009)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"air and water pollution in areas of northwest Bohemia and in northern Moravia around Ostrava present health risks;

During the interwar years, having rejected a federal system, the new country's predominantly Czech leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the Slovaks, the Sudeten Germans, and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). On the eve of World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the territory that today comprises the Czech Republic, and Slovakia became an independent state allied with Germany. After the war, a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create \"socialism with a human face,\" ushering in a period of repression known as \"normalization.\" The peaceful \"Velvet Revolution\" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a nonviolent \"velvet divorce\" into its two national components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"PRAGUE (capital) 1.314 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"15% (male 819,864/female 776,639)","15-24 years":"10.23% (male 559,108/female 529,598)","25-54 years":"43.7% (male 2,387,303/female 2,264,774)","55-64 years":"13.06% (male 673,060/female 717,296)","65 years and over":"18.01% (male 791,823/female 1,125,377) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"49.5%","youth dependency ratio":"22.5%","elderly dependency ratio":"27%","potential support ratio":"3.7% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"fewer than 100 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"121"},"Physicians density":{"value":"3.71 physicians/1,000 population (2010)"},"Languages":{"value":"Czech (official) 95.4%, Slovak 1.6%, other 3% (2011 census)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0.9% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"86.3%","note":"percent of women aged 18-49 (2008)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"3,400 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"111"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"2.33 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"43"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 10.4%, Protestant (includes Czech Brethren and Hussite) 1.1%, other and unspecified 54%, none 34.5% (2011 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"19.5%","male":"19.9%","female":"19% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"57"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"7.2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"63"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"29.1% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"21"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Czech(s)","adjective":"Czech"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Czech 64.3%, Moravian 5%, Slovak 1.4%, other 1.8%, unspecified 27.5% (2011 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"6.8 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.06 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.06 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.06 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.94 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.7 male(s)/female","total population":"0.97 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"41.3 years","male":"40 years","female":"42.6 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"10,644,842 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"85"},"Birth rate":{"value":"9.63 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"202"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"4.5% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"106"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"2% (2007)","country comparison to the world":"122"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"16 years","male":"16 years","female":"17 years (2012)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"NA","total population":"99%","male":"99%","female":"99% (2011 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.44 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"205"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.05% (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"120"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"78.48 years","male":"75.5 years","female":"81.62 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"55"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"2.63 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"2.76 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"2.49 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"216"},"Death rate":{"value":"10.34 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"37"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"73% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.35% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.16% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"185"}}}
