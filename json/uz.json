Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the Bolshevik Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic established in 1924. During the Soviet era, intensive production of \"white gold\" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies, which have left the land degraded and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry. Independent since 1991, the country has lessened its dependence on the cotton monoculture by diversifying agricultural production while developing its mineral and petroleum export capacity and increasing its manufacturing base. However, long-serving septuagenarian President Islom KARIMOV, who rose through the ranks of the Soviet-era State Planning Committee (Gosplan), remains wedded to the concepts of a command economy, creating a challenging environment for foreign investment. Current concerns include post-KARIMOV succession, terrorism by Islamic militants, economic stagnation, and the curtailment of human rights and democratization."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"TASHKENT (capital) 2.251 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"24.56% (male 3,676,029/female 3,496,916)","15-24 years":"19.92% (male 2,945,837/female 2,869,483)","25-54 years":"43.46% (male 6,310,206/female 6,379,037)","55-64 years":"7.17% (male 987,930/female 1,104,347)","65 years and over":"4.9% (male 610,272/female 819,885) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"49.7%","youth dependency ratio":"42.7%","elderly dependency ratio":"7%","potential support ratio":"14.3% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"2,200 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"55"},"Physicians density":{"value":"2.53 physicians/1,000 population (2013)"},"Languages":{"value":"Uzbek (official) 74.3%, Russian 14.2%, Tajik 4.4%, other 7.1%","note":"in the Karakalpakstan Republic, both the Karakalpak language and Uzbek have official status"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"64.9% (2006)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"32,300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"68"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-2.37 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"173"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 88% (mostly Sunni), Eastern Orthodox 9%, other 3%"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"6.1% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"118"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 12.7% of population (2012 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"14.3% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"119"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Uzbekistani","adjective":"Uzbekistani"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Uzbek 80%, Russian 5.5%, Tajik 5%, Kazakh 3%, Karakalpak 2.5%, Tatar 1.5%, other 2.5% (1996 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"4.4 beds/1,000 population (2010)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.06 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.99 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.9 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.74 male(s)/female","total population":"0.99 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"27.6 years","male":"27.1 years","female":"28.2 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"29,199,942 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"46"},"Birth rate":{"value":"17 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"108"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"NA"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"4.4% (2006)","country comparison to the world":"97"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"12 years","male":"12 years","female":"11 years (2011)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"99.6%","male":"99.7%","female":"99.5% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.79 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"153"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.15% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"104"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"73.55 years","male":"70.5 years","female":"76.78 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"128"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"19.2 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"22.78 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"15.4 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"91"},"Death rate":{"value":"5.3 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"180"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"36.4% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"1.45% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.93% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"123"}}}
