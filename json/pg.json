{"Introduction":{"Background":{"value":"The Spratly Islands consist of more than 100 small islands or reefs surrounded by rich fishing grounds - and potentially by gas and oil deposits. They are claimed in their entirety by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, while portions are claimed by Malaysia and the Philippines. About 45 islands are occupied by relatively small numbers of military forces from China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Since 1985 Brunei has claimed a continental shelf that overlaps a southern reef but has not made any formal claim to the reef. Brunei claims an exclusive economic zone over this area."}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"South China Sea 0 m","highest point":"unnamed location on Southwest Cay 4 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"8 38 N, 111 55 E"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"NA"},"Location":{"value":"Southeastern Asia, group of reefs and islands in the South China Sea, about two-thirds of the way from southern Vietnam to the southern Philippines"},"Geography - note":{"value":"strategically located near several primary shipping lanes in the central South China Sea; includes numerous small islands, atolls, shoals, and coral reefs"},"Coastline":{"value":"926 km"},"Land boundaries":{"value":"0 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Southeast Asia"},"Natural resources":{"value":"fish, guano, undetermined oil and natural gas potential"},"Terrain":{"value":"flat"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"NA"},"Climate":{"value":"tropical"},"Land use":{"agricultural land":"0%","value":"arable land 0%; permanent crops 0%; permanent pasture 0%","forest":"0%","other":"100% (2011 est.)"},"Maritime claims":{"value":"NA"},"Irrigated land":{"value":"5,700 sq km (2006)"},"Natural hazards":{"value":"typhoons; numerous reefs and shoals pose a serious maritime hazard"},"Area":{"total":"less than 5 sq km","land":"less than 5 sq km","water":"0 sq km","note":"includes 100 or so islets, coral reefs, and sea mounts scattered over an area of nearly 410,000 sq km (158,000 sq mi) of the central South China Sea","country comparison to the world":"249"}},"People and Society":{"Population":{"value":"no indigenous inhabitants","note":"there are scattered garrisons occupied by military personnel of several claimant states"}},"Government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Spratly Islands"}},"Economy":{"Economy - overview":{"value":"Economic activity is limited to commercial fishing.
