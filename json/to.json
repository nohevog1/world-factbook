Foreign direct investment inflows have slowed over recent years.

Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA, installed as military ruler in 1967, ruled Togo with a heavy hand for almost four decades. Despite the facade of multi-party elections instituted in the early 1990s, the government was largely dominated by President EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) party has been in power almost continually since 1967 and its successor, the Union for the Republic, maintains a majority of seats in today's legislature. Upon EYADEMA's death in February 2005, the military installed the president's son, Faure GNASSINGBE, and then engineered his formal election two months later. Democratic gains since then allowed Togo to hold its first relatively free and fair legislative elections in October 2007. After years of political unrest and condemnation from international organizations for human rights abuses, Togo is finally being re-welcomed into the international community."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"LOME (capital) 956,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"40.56% (male 1,536,301/female 1,527,018)","15-24 years":"19.51% (male 735,409/female 738,276)","25-54 years":"32.37% (male 1,214,388/female 1,230,218)","55-64 years":"4.24% (male 150,890/female 169,158)","65 years and over":"3.32% (male 108,474/female 142,186) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"81.8%","youth dependency ratio":"76.8%","elderly dependency ratio":"5%","potential support ratio":"19.9% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"4,300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"35"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.05 physicians/1,000 population (2008)"},"Languages":{"value":"French (official, the language of commerce), Ewe and Mina (the two major African languages in the south), Kabye (sometimes spelled Kabiye) and Dagomba (the two major African languages in the north)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 88.4% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"15.2% (2010)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"113,700 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"41"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"80"},"Religions":{"value":"Christian 29%, Muslim 20%, indigenous beliefs 51%"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"8.6% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"45"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 36.9% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"6.4% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"169"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Togolese (singular and plural)","adjective":"Togolese"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"African (37 tribes;
