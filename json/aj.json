Oil exports through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, the Baku-Novorossiysk, and the Baku-Supsa pipelines remain the main economic driver, but efforts to boost Azerbaijan's gas production are underway. The eventual completion of the geopolitically important Southern Gas Corridor between Azerbaijan and Europe will open up another, albeit, smaller source of revenue from gas exports. Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting market-based economic reforms. Pervasive public and private sector corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on long-term growth, particularly in non-energy sectors. Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress, including the need for stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance, while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term prospects depend on world oil prices, Azerbaijan's ability to negotiate export routes for its growing gas production, and its ability to use its energy wealth to promote growth and spur employment in non-energy sectors of the economy."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, metals, chemicals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"5.7%","industry":"61.2%","services":"33.2% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$10.64 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"97"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"oil and gas 90%, machinery, foodstuffs, cotton"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.4%","highest 10%":"27.4% (2008)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caspian Sea -28 m","highest point":"Bazarduzu Dagi 4,485 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"40 30 N, 47 30 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"34.68 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"12.21  cu km/yr (4%/18%/78%)","per capita":"1,384  cu m/yr (2010)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"local scientists consider the Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) (including Baku and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated area in the world because of severe air, soil, and water pollution;
