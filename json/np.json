Nepal is heavily dependent on remittances, which amount to as much as 22%-25% of GDP. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for more than 70% of the population and accounting for a little over one-third of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of agricultural products, including pulses, jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Nepal has considerable scope for exploiting its potential in hydropower, with an estimated 42,000 MW of commercially feasible capacity, but political uncertainty and a difficult business climate have hampered foreign investment. Additional challenges to Nepal's growth include its landlocked geographic location, persistent power shortages, underdeveloped transportation infrastructure, civil strife and labor unrest, and its susceptibility to natural disaster. The lack of political consensus in the past several years has delayed national budgets and prevented much-needed economic reform, although the government passed a full budget in 2013 and 2014.

That arrangement lasted until 1960, when political parties were again banned, but was reinstated in 1990 with the establishment of a multiparty democracy within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. An insurgency led by Maoists broke out in 1996. The ensuing 10-year civil war between Maoist and government forces witnessed the dissolution of the cabinet and parliament and the re-assumption of absolute power by the king in 2002. Several weeks of mass protests in April 2006 were followed by several months of peace negotiations between the Maoists and government officials, and culminated in a late 2006 peace accord and the 2007 promulgation of an interim constitution. Following a nationwide Constituent Assembly (CA) election in 2008, the newly formed CA declared Nepal a federal democratic republic, abolished the monarchy, and elected the country's first president. After the CA failed to draft a constitution by a May 2012 deadline set by the Supreme Court, then-Prime Minister Baburam BHATTARAI dissolved the CA. Months of negotiations ensued until March 2013 when the major political parties agreed to create an interim government headed by then-Chief Justice Khil Raj REGMI with a mandate to hold elections for a new CA. Elections were held in November 2013, in which the Nepali Congress won the largest share of seats in the CA and in February 2014 formed a coalition government with the second place Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist and with Nepali Congress President Sushil KOIRALA as prime minister. Nepal's new constitution came into effect in September 2015."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"KATHMANDU (capital) 1.183 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"30.72% (male 4,937,627/female 4,755,972)","15-24 years":"22.51% (male 3,580,083/female 3,522,047)","25-54 years":"36.5% (male 5,552,621/female 5,964,599)","55-64 years":"5.67% (male 874,350/female 913,683)","65 years and over":"4.6% (male 668,760/female 781,563) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"61.8%","youth dependency ratio":"52.9%","elderly dependency ratio":"9%","potential support ratio":"11.1% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"2,600 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"50"},"Languages":{"value":"Nepali (official) 44.6%, Maithali 11.7%, Bhojpuri 6%, Tharu 5.8%, Tamang 5.1%, Newar 3.2%, Magar 3%, Bajjika 3%, Urdu 2.6%, Avadhi 1.9%, Limbu 1.3%, Gurung 1.2%, other 10.4%, unspecified 0.2%","note":"123 languages reported as mother tongue in 2011 national census; many in government and business also speak English (2011 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 54.2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"49.7% (2011)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"38,800 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"63"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"3.86 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"33"},"Religions":{"value":"Hindu 81.3%, Buddhist 9%, Muslim 4.4%, Kirant 3.1%, Christian 1.4%, other 0.5%, unspecifed 0.2% (2011 est.)"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"6% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"125"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 8.4% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"2.9% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"189"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Nepali (singular and plural)","adjective":"Nepali"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Chhettri 16.6%, Brahman-Hill 12.2%, Magar 7.1%, Tharu 6.6%, Tamang 5.8%, Newar 5%, Kami 4.8%, Muslim 4.4%, Yadav 4%, Rai 2.3%, Gurung 2%, Damai/Dholii 1.8%, Thakuri 1.6%, Limbu 1.5%, Sarki 1.4%, Teli 1.4%, Chamar/Harijan/Ram 1.3%, Koiri/Kushwaha 1.2%, other 19%","note":"125 caste/ethnic groups were reported in the 2011 national census (2011 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"5 beds/1,000 population (2006)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.04 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.02 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.93 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.96 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.86 male(s)/female","total population":"0.98 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"23.4 years","male":"22.8 years","female":"24 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"31,551,305 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"42"},"Birth rate":{"value":"20.64 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"80"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"4.7% of GDP (2010)","country comparison to the world":"87"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"29.1% (2011)","country comparison to the world":"17"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"2,467,549","percentage":"34% (2008 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"12 years","male":"12 years","female":"12 years (2011)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"63.9%","male":"76.4%","female":"53.1% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.24 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"96"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.2% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"97"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"67.52 years","male":"66.18 years","female":"68.92 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"166"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"39.14 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"39.24 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"39.04 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"52"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.56 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"146"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"18.6% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"3.18% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.79% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"64"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A and E, and typhoid fever","vectorborne disease":"Japanese encephalitis, malaria, and dengue fever (2013)"}}}
