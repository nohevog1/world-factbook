Armenia has since switched to small-scale agriculture and away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. Armenia has only two open trade borders - Iran and Georgia - because its borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey have been closed since 1991 and 1993, respectively, as a result of Armenia's ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh region. Armenia's geographic isolation, a narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies in important business sectors have made it particularly vulnerable to the sharp deterioration in the global economy and the economic downturn in Russia. Armenia is particularly dependent on Russian commercial and governmental support and most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or managed, especially in the energy sector, including electricity and natural gas. Remittances from expatriates working in Russia are equivalent to about 20% of GDP and partly offset the country's severe trade imbalance. Armenia joined Russia in the Eurasian Economic Union upon the bloc's launch in January 2015, even though the ruble's sharp depreciation in December 2014 led to currency instability, inflation, and significant decrease of export from Armenia to Russia. Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. The government has made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been ineffective. Armenia will need to pursue additional economic reforms and to strengthen the rule of law in order to regain economic growth and improve economic competitiveness and employment opportunities, especially given its economic isolation from two of its nearest neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$144.8 million (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"119"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"natural gas, petroleum, tobacco products, foodstuffs, diamonds, pharmaceuticals, cars"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"21.9%","industry":"31.5%","services":"46.6% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$8.694 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"110"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"pig iron, unwrought copper, nonferrous metals, gold, diamonds, mineral products, foodstuffs, energy"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.7%","highest 10%":"24.8% (2012)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Debed River 400 m","highest point":"Aragats Lerrnagagat' 4,090 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"40 00 N, 45 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"7.77 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"2.86  cu km/yr (40%/6%/54%)","per capita":"929.7  cu m/yr (2010)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"soil pollution from toxic chemicals such as DDT;
