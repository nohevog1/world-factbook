Kosovo's citizens are the poorest in Europe with a per capita GDP (PPP) of $8,000 in 2014.  An unemployment rate of 31% encourages emigration and fuels a significant informal, unreported economy. Remittances from the diaspora - located mainly in Germany, Switzerland, and the Nordic countries - are estimated to account for about 15% of GDP. International donor assistance accounts for approximately 10% of Kosovo’s GDP. Most of Kosovo's population lives in rural towns outside of the capital, Pristina. Inefficient, near-subsistence farming is common - the result of small plots, limited mechanization, and a lack of technical expertise. Kosovo enjoys lower labor costs than the rest of the region. However, high levels of corruption and little contract enforcement have discouraged potential investors. With international assistance, Kosovo has been able to privatize a majority of its state-owned-enterprises. Minerals and metals production - including lignite, lead, zinc, nickel, chrome, aluminum, magnesium, and a wide variety of construction materials - once the backbone of industry, has declined because of ageing equipment and insufficient investment. A limited and unreliable electricity supply is a major impediment to economic development, but Kosovo has received technical assistance to help improve the sector’s performance. In 2012, Kosovo privatized its electricity supply and distribution network. The US Government is cooperating with the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) and the World Bank to conclude a commercial tender for the construction of a new power plant. MED also has plans for the rehabilitation of an older coal power plant, and the development of a coal mine that could supply both plants. In June 2009, Kosovo joined the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and began servicing its share of the former Yugoslavia's debt. In order to help integrate Kosovo into regional economic structures, UNMIK signed (on behalf of Kosovo) its accession to the Central Europe Free Trade Area (CEFTA) in 2006. Serbia and Bosnia previously had refused to recognize Kosovo's customs stamp or extend reduced tariff privileges for Kosovo products under CEFTA, but both countries resumed trade with Kosovo in 2011. Kosovo joined the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 2012 and the Council of Europe Development Bank in 2013. In 2014, Kosovo concluded the Stabilization and Association Agreement negotiations (SAA) with the EU, focused on trade liberalization. The SAA is expected to be signed by end of 2015.  The official currency of Kosovo is the euro, but the Serbian dinar is also used illegally in Serb majority communities. Kosovo's tie to the euro has helped keep core inflation low. Kosovo experienced its first federal budget deficit in 2012, when government expenditures climbed sharply. In May 2014, the government introduced a 25% salary increase for public sector employees and an equal increase in certain social benefits. Central revenues could not sustain these increases, and the Government was forced to reduce its planned capital investments. The government recently made changes to its fiscal policy that extended the list of duty-free imports, decreased the Value Added Tax (VAT) for basic food items and public utilities, and increased the VAT for all other goods."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"foodstuffs, livestock, wood, petroleum, chemicals, machinery, minerals, textiles, stone, ceramic and glass products, electrical equipment"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"12.9%","industry":"22.6%","services":"64.5% (2009 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$448.2 million (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"179"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"mining and processed metal products, scrap metals, leather products, machinery, appliances, prepared foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco, vegetable products, textiles and apparel"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Drini i Bardhe/Beli Drim 297 m (located on the border with Albania)","highest point":"Gjeravica/Deravica 2,656 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"42 35 N, 21 00 E"},"Location":{"value":"Southeast Europe, between Serbia and Macedonia"},"Coastline":{"value":"0 km (landlocked)"},"Land boundaries":{"total":"714 km","border countries (4)":"Albania 112 km, Macedonia 160 km, Montenegro 76 km, Serbia 366 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Europe"},"Natural resources":{"value":"nickel, lead, zinc, magnesium, lignite, kaolin, chrome, bauxite"},"Terrain":{"value":"flat fluvial basin at an elevation of 400-700 m above sea level surrounded by several high mountain ranges with elevations of 2,000 to 2,500 m"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"slightly larger than Delaware"},"Climate":{"value":"influenced by continental air masses resulting in relatively cold winters with heavy snowfall and hot, dry summers and autumns;

After international attempts to mediate the conflict failed, a three-month NATO military operation against Serbia beginning in March 1999 forced the Serbs to agree to withdraw their military and police forces from Kosovo. UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) placed Kosovo under a transitional administration, the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. A UN-led process began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's final status. The negotiations ran in stages between 2006 and 2007, but ended without agreement between Belgrade and Pristina. On 17 February 2008, the Kosovo Assembly declared Kosovo independent. Since then, over 100 countries have recognized Kosovo, and it has joined numerous international organizations. In October 2008, Serbia sought an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality under international law of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The ICJ released the advisory opinion in July 2010 affirming that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not violate general principles of international law, UN Security Council Resolution 1244, or the Constitutive Framework. The opinion was closely tailored to Kosovo's unique history and circumstances. Serbia continues to reject Kosovo's independence, but the two countries reached an agreement to normalize their relations in April 2013 through EU-facilitated talks and are currently engaged in the implementation process."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"PRISTINA (capital) 207,062 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"25.82% (male 250,907/female 232,112)","15-24 years":"17.74% (male 174,208/female 157,791)","25-54 years":"42.01% (male 414,684/female 371,339)","55-64 years":"7.4% (male 69,030/female 69,338)","65 years and over":"7.03% (male 55,107/female 76,465) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Languages":{"value":"Albanian (official) 94.5%, Bosnian 1.7%, Serbian (official) 1.6%, Turkish 1.1%, other 0.9% (includes Romani), unspecified 0.1%","note":"in municipalities where a community's mother tongue is not one of Kosovo's offical languages, the language of that community may be given official status according to the 2006 Law on the Use of Languages (2011 est.)"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 95.6%, Orthodox 1.5%, Roman Catholic 2.2%, other 0.07%, none 0.07%, unspecified 0.6% (2011 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"55.3%","male":"52%","female":"63.8% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"2"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Kosovar (Albanian), Kosovac (Serbian)","adjective":"Kosovar (Albanian), Kosovski (Serbian)","note":"Kosovan, a neutral term, is sometimes also used as a noun or adjective"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Albanians 92.9%, Bosniaks 1.6%, Serbs 1.5%, Turk 1.1%, Ashkali 0.9%, Egyptian 0.7%, Gorani 0.6%, Roma 0.5%, other/unspecified 0.2%","note":"these estimates may under-represent Serb, Roma, and some other ethnic minorities because they are based on the 2011 Kosovo national census, which excluded northern Kosovo (a largely Serb-inhabited region) and was partially boycotted by Serb and Roma communities in southern Kosovo (2011 est.)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.08 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.08 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.1 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.12 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.72 male(s)/female","total population":"1.06 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"28.2 years","male":"27.9 years","female":"28.6 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"1,870,981 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"151"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"91.9%","male":"96.6%","female":"87.5% (2003 est.)"}}}
