The US-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into force in 2006 and has helped foster foreign direct investment, but physical and political insecurity, as well as crime and perceptions of corruption, may deter potential investors; about 15% of foreign direct investment is from US firms. The economy registered modest economic growth of 2.6%-4.0% from 2010 to 2014, insufficient to improve living standards for the nearly 65% of the population in poverty. Honduras signed a three-year IMF stand-by arrangement in December 2014 that will help ease its poor fiscal position. In November 2014 along with his counterparts from El Salvador and Guatemala, President HERNANDEZ announced the “Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle.” This plan seeks to address the challenges facing the three Northern Triangle countries, including steps the governments will take to stimulate economic growth, increase transparency and fiscal responsibility, reduce violence, modernize the justice system, improve infrastructure, and promote educational opportunities over the next several years."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"communications equipment, machinery and transport, industrial raw materials, chemical products, fuels, foodstuffs"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"14%","industry":"27.4%","services":"58.7% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$6.636 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"117"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"coffee, apparel, coffee, shrimp, automobile wire harnesses, cigars, bananas, gold, palm oil, fruit, lobster, lumber"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"0.4%","highest 10%":"42.4% (2009 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Cerro Las Minas 2,870 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"15 00 N, 86 30 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"95.93 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"2.12  cu km/yr (16%/23%/61%)","per capita":"295.6  cu m/yr (2006)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"urban population expanding;
