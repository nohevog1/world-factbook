The countryâ€™s climate and soil make it feasible to grow a wide range of cash crops, fruit, vegetables, and tubers; however, cashews generate more than 80% export receipts and are the main source of income for many rural communities. With renewed donor support following elections in April-May 2014 and a successful regional bond issuance, the new government of Guinea-Bissau has made progress paying salaries, settling domestic arrears, and gaining more control over revenues and expenditures.

In 1980, a military coup established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a path to a market economy and multiparty system, VIEIRA's regime was characterized by the suppression of political opposition and the purging of political rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the country's first free election. A military mutiny and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In February 2000, a transitional government turned over power to opposition leader Kumba YALA after he was elected president in transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in office, YALA was overthrown in a bloodless military coup, and businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In 2005, former President VIEIRA was reelected, pledging to pursue economic development and national reconciliation; he was assassinated in March 2009. Malam Bacai SANHA was elected in an emergency election held in June 2009, but he passed away in January 2012 from a long-term illness. A military coup in April 2012 prevented Guinea-Bissau's second-round presidential election - to determine SANHA's successor - from taking place. Following mediation by the Economic Community of Western African States, a civilian transitional government assumed power in 2012 and remained until Jose Mario VAZ won free and fair elections in 2014."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"BISSAU (capital) 492,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"39.53% (male 340,575/female 341,747)","15-24 years":"20.18% (male 172,787/female 175,511)","25-54 years":"32.3% (male 277,820/female 279,762)","55-64 years":"4.66% (male 30,010/female 50,354)","65 years and over":"3.34% (male 21,671/female 35,933) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"78.4%","youth dependency ratio":"72.8%","elderly dependency ratio":"5.7%","potential support ratio":"17.7% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"1,900 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"57"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.1 physicians/1,000 population (2009)"},"Languages":{"value":"Crioulo 90.4%, Portuguese 27.1% (official), French 5.1%, English 2.9%, other 2.4%","note":"shares sum to more than 100% because some respondents gave more than one answer on the census (2008 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 79.2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"14.2% (2010)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"42,000 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"59"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"94"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 45.1%, Christian 22.1%, animist 14.9%, none 2%, unspecified 15.9% (2008 est.)"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"5.5% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"116"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 20.7% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"6.3% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"159"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Bissau-Guinean(s)","adjective":"Bissau-Guinean"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Fula 28.5%, Balanta 22.5%, Mandinga 14.7%, Papel 9.1%, Manjaco 8.3%, Beafada 3.5%, Mancanha 3.1%, Bijago 2.1%, Felupe 1.7%, Mansoanca 1.4%, Balanta Mane 1%, other 1.8%, none 2.2% (2008 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"1 beds/1,000 population (2009)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.98 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.99 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.6 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.6 male(s)/female","total population":"0.95 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"19.9 years","male":"19.4 years","female":"20.4 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"1,726,170 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"153"},"Birth rate":{"value":"33.38 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"31"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"NA"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"18.1% (2010)","country comparison to the world":"35"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"226,316","percentage":"57% (2010 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"9 years","male":"NA","female":"NA (2006)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"59.9%","male":"71.8%","female":"48.3% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"4.23 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"32"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"3.69% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"17"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"50.23 years","male":"48.21 years","female":"52.31 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"223"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"89.21 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"98.8 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"79.33 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"5"},"Death rate":{"value":"14.33 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"4"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"49.3% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"4.13% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.91% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"56"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"malaria, dengue fever, and yellow fever","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
