{"Introduction":{"Background":{"value":"Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of \"prisoner\" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties, which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984, a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions, including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom, threats against minority Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East, sexual misconduct by clergy, international development, interreligious dialogue and reconciliation, and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1.2 billion people worldwide profess Catholicism - the world's largest Christian faith."}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Saint Peter's Square 19 m","highest point":"Vatican Gardens (Vatican Hill) 77 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"41 54 N, 12 27 E"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Ozone Layer Protection","signed, but not ratified":"Air Pollution, Environmental Modification"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"NA"},"Location":{"value":"Southern Europe, an enclave of Rome (Italy)"},"Geography - note":{"value":"landlocked;

these help fund the Roman Curia (Vatican bureaucracy), diplomatic missions, and media outlets. Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and from direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund, known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief, and aid to churches in developing nations. Donations increased between 2010 and 2011. The separate Vatican City State budget includes the Vatican museums and post office and is supported financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals, and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publication sales. Its revenues increased between 2010 and 2011 because of expanded opening hours and a growing number of visitors. However, the Holy See has not escaped the financial difficulties engulfing other European countries; in 2012 it started a spending review to determine where to cut costs to reverse its 2011 budget deficit of $20 million. The Holy See generated a modest surplus in 2012 before recording a $32 million deficit in 2013, driven primarily by the decreasing value of gold. Most public expenditures go to wages and other personnel costs; the incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome. In February 2014, Pope FRANCIS created the Secretariat of the Economy to oversee financial and administrative operations of the Holy See, part of a broader campaign to reform the Holy See’s finances."}},"Communications":{"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"automatic digital exchange","domestic":"connected via fiber optic cable to Telecom Italia network","international":"country code - 39; uses Italian system (2012)"},"Broadcast media":{"value":"the Vatican Television Center (CTV) transmits live broadcasts of the Pope's Sunday and Wednesday audiences, as well as the Pope's public celebrations; CTV also produces documentaries; Vatican Radio is the Holy See's official broadcasting service broadcasting via shortwave, AM and FM frequencies, and via satellite and Internet connections (2008)"},"Radio broadcast stations":{"value":"AM 5, FM 3, shortwave 5 (2008)"},"Television broadcast stations":{"value":"1 (2008)"},"Internet country code":{"value":".va"}},"Military":{"Military branches":{"value":"Pontifical Swiss Guard Corps (Corpo della Guardia Svizzera Pontificia) (2013)"},"Military service age and obligation":{"value":"Pontifical Swiss Guard Corps (Corpo della Guardia Svizzera Pontificia): 19-30 years of age for voluntary military service; no conscription; must be Roman Catholic, a Swiss citizen, with a secondary education (2013)"},"Military - note":{"value":"defense is the responsibility of Italy; ceremonial and limited security duties performed by Pontifical Swiss Guard"}},"Transnational Issues":{"Disputes - international":{"value":"none"}}}
