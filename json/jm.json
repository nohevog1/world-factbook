The country continues to derive most of its foreign exchange from tourism, remittances, and bauxite/alumina. Remittances and tourism each account for 30% of GDP, while bauxite/alumina exports make up roughly 5% of GDP. The bauxite/alumina sector was most affected by the global downturn while the tourism industry and remittance flow remained resilient. Jamaica's economy faces many challenges to growth: high crime and corruption, large-scale unemployment and underemployment, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 130%. The attendant debt servicing cost consumes a large portion of the government's budget, limiting its ability to fund the critical infrastructure and social programs required to drive growth. Jamaica's economic growth rate in the recent past has been stagnant, averaging less than 1% per year for over 20 years. Jamaica's onerous public debt burden is largely the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy, most notably to the financial sector. In early 2010, the Jamaican Government initiated the Jamaica Debt Exchange to retire high-priced domestic bonds and reduce annual debt servicing. Despite these efforts, debt continued to be a serious concern, forcing the government to negotiate and sign a new IMF agreement in May 2013 to gain access to approximately $1 billion additional funds. As a precursor, the government instigated a second National Debt Exchange in 2012. The IMF deal requires the government to reform its tax system, eliminate discretionary tax exemptions and waivers, and achieve an annual surplus of 7.5%, excluding debt payments, to reduce its debt below 100% of GDP by 2020. The SIMPSON-MILLER administration now faces the difficult prospect of having to achieve fiscal discipline to maintain debt payments while simultaneously attacking a serious crime problem that is hampering economic growth. High unemployment exacerbates the crime problem, including gang violence that is fueled by the drug trade."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$6.626 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"84"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"food and other consumer goods, industrial supplies, fuel, parts and accessories of capital goods, machinery and transport equipment, construction materials"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"6.9%","industry":"21.1%","services":"72% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$15.24 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"92"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"alumina, bauxite, sugar, rum, coffee, yams, beverages, chemicals, apparel, mineral fuels"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.1%","highest 10%":"35.8% (2004)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Blue Mountain Peak 2,256 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"18 15 N, 77 30 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"9.4 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.93  cu km/yr (32%/16%/52%)","per capita":"369.9  cu m/yr (2009)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"heavy rates of deforestation;

The native Taino, who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England seized the island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based on sugar, cocoa, and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter million slaves, many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica gradually increased its independence from Britain. In 1958 it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew from the Federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated with the major political parties evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money laundering. Violent crime, drug trafficking, and poverty pose significant challenges to the government today. Nonetheless, many rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute substantially to the economy."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"KINGSTON (capital) 588,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"27.97% (male 419,725/female 405,573)","15-24 years":"21.46% (male 317,873/female 315,163)","25-54 years":"37% (male 538,173/female 553,486)","55-64 years":"5.69% (male 81,281/female 86,713)","65 years and over":"7.87% (male 103,958/female 128,265) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"48.6%","youth dependency ratio":"35%","elderly dependency ratio":"13.6%","potential support ratio":"7.4% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"1,300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"62"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.41 physicians/1,000 population (2008)"},"Languages":{"value":"English, English patois"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 18.2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"72.5% (2008/09)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"29,400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"71"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-4.66 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"191"},"Religions":{"value":"Protestant 64.8% (includes Seventh Day Adventist 12.0%, Pentecostal 11.0%, Other Church of God 9.2%, New Testament Church of God 7.2%, Baptist 6.7%, Church of God in Jamaica 4.8%, Church of God of Prophecy 4.5%, Anglican 2.8%, United Church 2.1%, Methodist 1.6%, Revived 1.4%, Brethren .9%, and Moravian .7%), Roman Catholic 2.2%, Jehovah's Witness 1.9%, Rastafarian 1.1%, other 6.5%, none 21.3%, unspecified 2.3% (2011 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"34%","male":"27.1%","female":"42.6% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"20"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"5.9% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"114"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 6.2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"26.8% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"67"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Jamaican(s)","adjective":"Jamaican"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"black 92.1%, mixed 6.1%, East Indian 0.8%, other 0.4%, unspecified 0.7% (2011 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"1.7 beds/1,000 population (2012)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.97 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.94 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.81 male(s)/female","total population":"0.98 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"25.3 years","male":"24.8 years","female":"25.8 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"2,950,210 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"139"},"Birth rate":{"value":"18.16 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"102"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"6.3% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"40"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"3.2% (2010)","country comparison to the world":"112"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"38,516","percentage":"6% (2005 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"12 years","male":"12 years","female":"13 years (2013)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over has ever attended school","total population":"88.7%","male":"84%","female":"93.1% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.01 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"121"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"1.62% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"31"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"73.55 years","male":"71.93 years","female":"75.24 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"127"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"13.37 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"13.93 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"12.78 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"112"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.7 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"140"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"54.8% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.9% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.68% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"148"}}}
