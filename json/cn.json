The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Currently, authorities are negotiating with the IMF for triennial program assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, accounts for 50% of GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. Export income is heavily reliant on the three main crops of vanilla, cloves, and ylang-ylang; and Comoros' export earnings are easily disrupted by disasters such as fires and extreme weather. Despite agriculture’s importance to the economy, the country imports roughly 70% of its food; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The government - which is racked by internal political disputes - is struggling to provide basic services, upgrade education and technical training, privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, improve health services, diversify exports, promote tourism, and reduce the high population growth rate. Recurring political instability, sometimes initiated  from outside  the country,  has inhibited growth. Remittances from about 200,000 Comoran diaspora contribute about 25% of the country’s GDP. In December 2012, IMF and the World Bank's International Development Association supported $176 million in debt relief for Comoros, resulting in a 59% reduction of its future external debt service over a period of 40 years. In late 2013, a US-based investment company invested $200 million in a project to explore for hydrocarbons in Comoran territorial waters, the largest financial investment in the country’s history."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"rice and other foodstuffs, consumer goods, petroleum products, cement and construction materials, transport equipment"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"50.4%","industry":"13.7%","services":"35.9% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$251.4 million (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"186"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"vanilla, ylang-ylang (perfume essence), cloves"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"0.9%","highest 10%":"55.2% (2004)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Karthala 2,360 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"12 10 S, 44 15 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"1.2 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.01  cu km/yr (48%/5%/47%)","per capita":"16.86  cu m/yr (1999)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"soil degradation and erosion results from crop cultivation on slopes without proper terracing;

France did not recognize the independence of Mayotte, which remains under French administration. Since independence, Comoros has endured political instability through realized and attempted coups. In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999, military chief Col. AZALI Assoumani seized power of the entire government in a bloodless coup; he initiated the 2000 Fomboni Accords, a power-sharing agreement in which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and each island maintains its local government. AZALI won the 2002 federal presidential election as president from Grand Comore island, and each island in the archipelago elected its president. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President SAMBI was elected to office as president from Anjouan. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan's de-facto secession from the Union of Comoros, refusing to step down when Comoros' other islands held legitimate elections in July. The African Union (AU) initially attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying sanctions and a naval blockade to Anjouan, but in March 2008 the AU and Comoran soldiers seized the island. The island's inhabitants generally welcomed the move. In May 2011, Ikililou DHOININE won the presidency in peaceful elections widely deemed to be free and fair."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"MORONI (capital) 56,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"40.77% (male 158,654/female 159,722)","15-24 years":"18.98% (male 71,694/female 76,500)","25-54 years":"32.25% (male 119,595/female 132,299)","55-64 years":"4.17% (male 14,414/female 18,135)","65 years and over":"3.84% (male 14,018/female 15,940) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"75.6%","youth dependency ratio":"70.7%","elderly dependency ratio":"4.9%","potential support ratio":"20.4% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Languages":{"value":"Arabic (official), French (official), Shikomoro (official; a blend of Swahili and Arabic) (Comorian)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 35.8% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"19.4% (2012)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-2.53 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"175"},"Religions":{"value":"Sunni Muslim 98%, Roman Catholic 2%"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"5.8% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"153"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 9.9% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"5.8% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"164"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Comoran(s)","adjective":"Comoran"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Antalote, Cafre, Makoa, Oimatsaha, Sakalava"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"2.2 beds/1,000 population (2006)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"0.99 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.94 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.9 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.8 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.88 male(s)/female","total population":"0.94 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"19.4 years","male":"18.7 years","female":"20 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"780,971 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"164"},"Birth rate":{"value":"27.84 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"45"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"7.6% of GDP (2008)","country comparison to the world":"15"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"16.9% (2012)","country comparison to the world":"39"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"39,550","percentage":"27% (2000 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"11 years","male":"NA","female":"NA (2013)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"77.8%","male":"81.8%","female":"73.7% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"3.6 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"43"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"63.85 years","male":"61.57 years","female":"66.19 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"182"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"63.55 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"74.18 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"52.6 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"19"},"Death rate":{"value":"7.57 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"111"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"28.3% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"2.67% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.77% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"67"}}}
