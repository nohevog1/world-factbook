The government in April 2011 held the first Cuban Communist Party Congress in almost 13 years, during which leaders approved a plan for wide-ranging economic changes. Since then, the Cuban government has slowly and incrementally implemented limited economic reforms, including allowing Cubans to buy electronic appliances and cell phones, stay in hotels, and buy and sell used cars. As the Cuban government has cut state sector jobs as part of the reform process, it has opened up some retail services to \"self-employment,\" leading to the rise of so-called \"cuentapropistas\" or entrepreneurs.  Approximately 476,000 Cuban workers are currently registered as self-employed. Recent moves include permitting the private ownership and sale of real estate and new vehicles, allowing private farmers to sell agricultural goods directly to hotels, allowing the creation of non-agricultural cooperatives, adopting a new foreign investment law, and launching a “Special Development Zone” around the Mariel port. Despite these reforms, the average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level than before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting downturn of the 1990s. Since late 2000, Venezuela has been providing oil on preferential terms, and it supplied nearly 160,000 barrels per day of petroleum products. Cuba has been paying for the oil, in part, with the services of Cuban personnel in Venezuela, including some 30,000 medical professionals.  However, in 2013 Venezuela’s economic woes forced an estimated 24% reduction in oil exports to Cuba. This downward trend continued in 2014."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum, food, machinery and equipment, chemicals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"3.8%","industry":"14.3%","services":"81.9% (2013 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$24.65 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"79"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum, nickel, medical products, sugar, tobacco, fish, citrus, coffee"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Pico Turquino 2,005 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"21 30 N, 80 00 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"38.12 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"4.42  cu km/yr (22%/14%/65%)","per capita":"392.6  cu m/yr (2010)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Marine Life Conservation"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"air and water pollution;

Also in FY 2014, 24,289 Cuban migrants presented themselves at various land border ports of entry throughout the US.
