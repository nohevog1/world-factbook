Remittances accounted for 17% of GDP in 2014 and were received by about a third of all households. In 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which has bolstered the export of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector amid increased Asian competition. The Salvadoran Government maintained fiscal discipline during post-war reconstruction and reconstruction following earthquakes in 2001 and hurricanes in 1998 and 2005, but El Salvador's public debt has been growing over the last several years, amounting to some 59% of GDP in 2014. External debt was below 30% of GDP in 2014. In September 2014, El Salvador signed a five-year $277 million second compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) - a United States Government agency aimed at stimulating economic growth and reducing poverty - to improve El Salvador's competitiveness and productivity in international markets. In November 2014 along with his counterparts from Guatemala and Honduras, President SANCHEZ CEREN announced the “Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle.” This plan seeks to address the challenges facing the three Northern Triangle countries, including steps the governments will take to stimulate economic growth, increase transparency and fiscal responsibility, reduce violence, modernize the justice system, improve infrastructure, and promote educational opportunities over the next several years."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$4.227 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"73"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"raw materials, consumer goods, capital goods, fuels, foodstuffs, petroleum, electricity"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"10%","industry":"25.1%","services":"64.9% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$14.01 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"95"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"offshore assembly exports, coffee, sugar, textiles and apparel, gold, ethanol, chemicals, electricity, iron and steel manufactures"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"1%","highest 10%":"37% (2009 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Cerro El Pital 2,730 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"13 50 N, 88 55 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"25.23 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"1.84  cu km/yr (22%/14%/64%)","per capita":"301.9  cu m/yr (2007)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation;
