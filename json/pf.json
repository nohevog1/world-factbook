{"Introduction":{"Background":{"value":"The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive fishing grounds and by potential oil and gas reserves. In 1932, French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island; maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has occupied all the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands. China built a military installation on Woody Island with an airfield and artificial harbor. The islands also are claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam."}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"South China Sea 0 m","highest point":"unnamed location on Rocky Island 14 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"16 30 N, 112 00 E"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"NA"},"Location":{"value":"Southeastern Asia, group of small islands and reefs in the South China Sea, about one-third of the way from central Vietnam to the northern Philippines"},"Geography - note":{"value":"composed of 130 small coral islands and reefs divided into the northeast Amphitrite Group and the western Crescent Group"},"Coastline":{"value":"518 km"},"Land boundaries":{"value":"0 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Southeast Asia"},"Natural resources":{"value":"none"},"Terrain":{"value":"mostly low and flat"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"NA"},"Climate":{"value":"tropical"},"Land use":{"agricultural land":"0%","value":"arable land 0%; permanent crops 0%; permanent pasture 0%","forest":"0%","other":"100% (2011 est.)"},"Maritime claims":{"value":"NA"},"Irrigated land":{"value":"0 sq km (2011)"},"Natural hazards":{"value":"typhoons"},"Area":{"total":"ca. 7.75 sq km","land":"ca. 7.75 sq km","water":"0 sq km"}},"People and Society":{"Population":{"value":"no indigenous inhabitants","note":"there are scattered Chinese garrisons"}},"Government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Paracel Islands"}},"Economy":{"Economy - overview":{"value":"The islands have the potential for oil and gas development.
