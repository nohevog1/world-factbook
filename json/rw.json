Tourism, minerals, coffee and tea are Rwanda's main sources of foreign exchange. The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely impoverished the population, particularly women, and temporarily stalled the country's ability to attract private and external investment. However, Rwanda has made substantial progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy to pre-1994 levels. GDP has rebounded with an average annual growth of 7%-8% since 2003 and inflation has been reduced to single digits. Nonetheless, a significant percent of the population still live below the official poverty line; 45% of the population now lives below the poverty line, compared to 57% in 2006. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with demand, requiring food imports In recognition of Rwanda's successful management of its macro economy, in 2010, the IMF graduated Rwanda to a Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Africa's most densely populated country is trying to overcome the limitations of its small, landlocked economy by leveraging regional trade; Rwanda joined the East African Community and is aligning its budget, trade, and immigration policies with its regional partners. The government has embraced an expansionary fiscal policy to reduce poverty by improving education, infrastructure, and foreign and domestic investment and pursuing market-oriented reforms. Energy shortages, instability in neighboring states, and lack of adequate transportation linkages to other countries continue to handicap private sector growth. The Rwandan Government is seeking to become regional leader in information and communication technologies. In 2012, Rwanda completed the first modern Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Kigali. The SEZ seeks to attract investment in all sectors, but specifically in agribusiness, information and communications technologies, trade and logistics, mining, and construction."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"foodstuffs, machinery and equipment, steel, petroleum products, cement and construction material"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"32.5%","industry":"14.8%","services":"52.7% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$1.8 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"147"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"coffee, tea, hides, tin ore"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.1%","highest 10%":"43.2% (2011 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Rusizi River 950 m","highest point":"Volcan Karisimbi 4,519 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"2 00 S, 30 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"9.5 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.15  cu km/yr (33%/11%/55%)","per capita":"17.25  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation results from uncontrolled cutting of trees for fuel;

Over the next several years, thousands of Tutsis were killed, and some 150,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries. The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and began a civil war in 1990. The war, along with several political and economic upheavals, exacerbated ethnic tensions, culminating in April 1994 in a state-orchestrated genocide, in which Rwandans killed up to a million of their fellow citizens, including approximately three-quarters of the Tutsi population. The genocide ended later that same year when the predominantly Tutsi RPF, operating out of Uganda and northern Rwanda, defeated the national army and Hutu militias, and established an RPF-led government of national unity. Approximately 2 million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and former Zaire. Since then, most of the refugees have returned to Rwanda, but several thousand remained in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, the former Zaire) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on retaking Rwanda, much as the RPF did in 1990. Rwanda held its first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections in 2003. Rwanda in 2009 staged a joint military operation with the Congolese Army in DRC to rout out the Hutu extremist insurgency there, and Kigali and Kinshasa restored diplomatic relations. Rwanda also joined the Commonwealth in late 2009 and assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2013-14 term."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"KIGALI (capital) 1.257 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"41.83% (male 2,670,040/female 2,626,646)","15-24 years":"18.86% (male 1,193,523/female 1,193,953)","25-54 years":"32.72% (male 2,077,406/female 2,065,261)","55-64 years":"4.07% (male 239,924/female 274,829)","65 years and over":"2.53% (male 131,613/female 188,538) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"78.1%","youth dependency ratio":"73.1%","elderly dependency ratio":"5%","potential support ratio":"20.1% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"3,000 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"45"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.06 physicians/1,000 population (2010)"},"Languages":{"value":"Kinyarwanda only (official, universal Bantu vernacular) 93.2%, Kinyarwanda and other language(s) 6.2%, French (official) and other language(s) 0.1%, English (official) and other language(s) 0.1%, Swahili (or Kiswahili, used in commercial centers) 0.02%, other 0.03%, unspecified 0.3% (2002 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 38.4% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"51.6% (2010/11)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"210,500 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"29"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0.85 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"66"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 49.5%, Protestant 39.4% (includes Adventist 12.2% and other Protestant 27.2%), other Christian 4.5%, Muslim 1.8%, animist 0.1%, other 0.6%, none 3.6% (2001), unspecified 0.5% (2002 est.)"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"11.1% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"18"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 23.9% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"3.3% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"170"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Rwandan(s)","adjective":"Rwandan"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Hutu (Bantu) 84%, Tutsi (Hamitic) 15%, Twa (Pygmy) 1%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"1.6 beds/1,000 population (2007)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.02 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.87 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.7 male(s)/female","total population":"0.99 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"18.8 years","male":"18.6 years","female":"19 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"12,661,733","note":"estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS;
