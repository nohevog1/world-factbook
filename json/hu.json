In late 2008, Hungary's impending inability to service its short-term debt - brought on by the global financial crisis - led Budapest to obtain an IMF/EU/World Bank-arranged financial assistance package worth over $25 billion. The global economic downturn, declining exports, and low domestic consumption and investment, dampened by government austerity measures, resulted in a severe economic contraction in 2009. In 2010 the new government implemented a number of changes including cutting business and personal income taxes, but imposed \"crisis taxes\" on financial institutions, energy and telecom companies, and retailers. The IMF/EU bail-out program lapsed at the end of 2010 and was replaced by Post Program Monitoring and Article IV Consultations on overall economic and fiscal processes. At the end of 2011 the government turned to the IMF and the EU to obtain financial backstop to support its efforts to refinance foreign currency debt and bond obligations in 2012 and beyond, but Budapest's rejection of EU and IMF economic policy recommendations led to a breakdown in talks with the lenders in late 2012. Global demand for high yield has since helped Hungary to obtain funds on international markets. Hungaryâ€™s progress reducing its deficit to under 3% of GDP led the European Commission in 2013 to permit Hungary for the first time since joining the EU in 2004 to exit the Excessive Deficit Procedure."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$27.71 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"62"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment 45.4%, other manufactures 34.3%, fuels and electricity 12.6%, food products 5.3%, raw materials 2.5% (2012)"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"3.4%","industry":"31.1%","services":"65.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$167.1 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"35"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment 53.5%, other manufactures 31.2%, food products 8.7%, raw materials 3.4%, fuels and electricity 3.9% (2012 est.)"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.1%","highest 10%":"22.6% (2009)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Tisza River 78 m","highest point":"Kekes 1,014 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"47 00 N, 20 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"104 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"5.58  cu km/yr (12%/83%/5%)","per capita":"555.9  cu m/yr (2007)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"the upgrading of Hungary's standards in waste management, energy efficiency, and air, soil, and water pollution to meet EU requirements will require large investments"},"Location":{"value":"Central Europe, northwest of Romania"},"Geography - note":{"value":"landlocked;

The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy, introducing so-called \"Goulash Communism.\" Hungary held its first multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy.
