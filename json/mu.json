Muscat also is focused on creating more jobs to employ the rising numbers of Omanis entering the workforce. Tourism and gas-based industries are key components of the government's diversification strategy. However, increases in social welfare benefits, particularly since the Arab Spring, have challenged the government's ability to effectively balance its budget as oil prices decline. Despite government acknowledgement that Omanâ€™s expansive social welfare benefits are unsustainable, Oman authorities are comfortable with short-term budget deficits and have approved an expansionary 2015 budget. Concurrently, Oman has expanded efforts to support the development of small and medium-size enterprises and entrepreneurship. Government agencies and large oligarchic group companies have announced new initiatives to spin off non-essential functions to entrepreneurs, incubate new businesses, train and mentor up and coming business people, and provide financing for start-ups."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$20.27 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"66"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, food, livestock, lubricants"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"1.3%","industry":"55.2%","services":"43.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$10.83 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"102"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum, reexports, fish, metals, textiles"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Arabian Sea 0 m","highest point":"Jabal Shams 2,980 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"21 00 N, 57 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"1.4 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"1.32  cu km/yr (10%/1%/88%)","per capita":"515.8  cu m/yr (2003)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"rising soil salinity;

In the late 18th century, a newly established sultanate in Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship treaties with Britain. Over time, Oman's dependence on British political and military advisors increased, but it never became a British colony. In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew his father, and has since ruled as sultan, but he has never designated a successor. His extensive modernization program has opened the country to the outside world while preserving the longstanding close ties with the UK. Oman's moderate, independent foreign policy has sought to maintain good relations with all Middle Eastern countries. Inspired by the popular uprisings that swept the Middle East and North Africa beginning in January 2011, some Omanis began staging marches, demonstrations, and sit-ins calling mostly for more jobs and economic benefits and an end to corruption. In response to those protester demands, QABOOS in 2011 pledged to implement economic and political reforms, such as granting legislative and regulatory powers to the Majlis al-Shura and introducing unemployment benefits. Additionally, in August 2012, the Sultan announced a royal directive mandating the speedy implementation of a national job creation plan for thousands of public and private sector jobs. As part of the government's efforts to decentralize authority and allow greater citizen participation in local governance, Oman successfully conducted its first municipal council elections in December 2012. Announced by the Sultan in 2011, the municipal councils will have the power to advise the Royal Court on the needs of local districts across Oman's 11 governorates. The Sultan returned to Oman in March 2015 after eight months in Germany, where he received medical treatment."}},"People and Society":{"Nationality":{"noun":"Omani(s)","adjective":"Omani"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Arab, Baluchi, South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi), African"},"Languages":{"value":"Arabic (official), English, Baluchi, Urdu, Indian dialects"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim (official; majority are Ibadhi, lesser numbers of Sunni and Shia)) 85.9%, Christian 6.5%, Hindu 5.5%, Buddhist 0.8%, Jewish \nnote: approximately 75% of Omani citizens, who compose almost 70% of the country's total population, are Ibadhi Muslims; the Omani government does not keep statistics on religious affiliation (2013) (2010 est.)\nreligious affiliation:\n \n          \nPopulation:\n3,286,936\nnote: immigrants make up just over 30% of the total population, according to UN data (2013) (July 2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  135\nAge structure:\n0-14 years: 30.23% (male 509,465/female 484,068)\n15-24 years: 19.51% (male 336,286/female 304,994)\n25-54 years: 43% (male 822,302/female 590,937)\n55-64 years: 3.9% (male 68,460/female 59,756)\n65 years and over: 3.37% (male 55,081/female 55,587) (2015 est.)\npopulation pyramid:\n \n          \nDependency ratios:\ntotal dependency ratio: 30%\nyouth dependency ratio: 26.7%\nelderly dependency ratio: 3.4%\npotential support ratio: 29.8% (2015 est.)\nMedian age:\ntotal: 25.1 years\nmale: 26.3 years\nfemale: 23.7 years (2015 est.)\nPopulation growth rate:\n2.07% (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  47\nBirth rate:\n24.44 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  56\nDeath rate:\n3.36 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  218\nNet migration rate:\n-0.43 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  132\nUrbanization:\nurban population: 77.6% of total population (2015)\nrate of urbanization: 8.54% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)\nMajor urban areas - population:\nMUSCAT (capital) 838,000 (2015)\nSex ratio:\nat birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\n0-14 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n15-24 years: 1.1 male(s)/female\n25-54 years: 1.39 male(s)/female\n55-64 years: 1.15 male(s)/female\n65 years and over: 0.99 male(s)/female\ntotal population: 1.2 male(s)/female (2015 est.)\nInfant mortality rate:\ntotal: 13.55 deaths/1,000 live births\nmale: 13.85 deaths/1,000 live births\nfemale: 13.23 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  110\nLife expectancy at birth:\ntotal population: 75.21 years\nmale: 73.29 years\nfemale: 77.23 years (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  103\nTotal fertility rate:\n2.86 children born/woman (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  59\nContraceptive prevalence rate:\n24.4% (2007/08)\nHealth expenditures:\n2.6% of GDP (2013)\ncountry comparison to the world:  185\nPhysicians density:\n2.43 physicians/1,000 population (2012)\nHospital bed density:\n1.7 beds/1,000 population (2012)\nDrinking water source:\nimproved: \nurban: 95.5% of population\nrural: 86.1% of population\ntotal: 93.4% of population\nunimproved: \nurban: 4.5% of population\nrural: 13.9% of population\ntotal: 6.6% of population (2015 est.)\nSanitation facility access:\nimproved: \nurban: 97.3% of population\nrural: 94.7% of population\ntotal: 96.7% of population\nunimproved: \nurban: 2.7% of population\nrural: 5.3% of population\ntotal: 3.3% of population (2015 est.)\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate:\n0.16% (2014 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  101\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS:\nNA\nHIV/AIDS - deaths:\nless than 100 (2014 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  114\nObesity - adult prevalence rate:\n26.5% (2014)\ncountry comparison to the world:  94\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight:\n8.6% (2009)\ncountry comparison to the world:  73\nEducation expenditures:\n4.2% of GDP (2009)\ncountry comparison to the world:  100\nLiteracy:\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 91.1%\nmale: 93.6%\nfemale: 85.6% (2015 est.)\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education):\ntotal: 14 years\nmale: 14 years\nfemale: 14 years (2011)\n"}}}
