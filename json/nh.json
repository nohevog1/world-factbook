Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with nearly 197,000 visitors in 2008, are other mainstays of the economy. Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances from main markets and between constituent islands. In response to foreign concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center. In mid-2002, the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism through improved air connections, resort development, and cruise ship facilities. Agriculture, especially livestock farming, is a second target for growth. Australia and New Zealand are the main suppliers of tourists and foreign aid."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, fuels"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"25.1%","industry":"10.8%","services":"64.1% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$369.2 million (31 December 2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"183"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"copra, beef, cocoa, timber, kava, coffee"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Tabwemasana 1,877 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"16 00 S, 167 00 E"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 94","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"most of the population does not have access to a reliable supply of potable water;
