Services include operating the Panama Canal, logistics, banking, the Colon Free Trade Zone, insurance, container ports, flagship registry, and tourism. Economic growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is estimated to be completed by 2016 at a cost of $5.3 billion - about 10-15% of current GDP. The expansion project will more than double the Canal's capacity, enabling it to accommodate ships that are too large to traverse the existing canal. The United States and China are the top users of the Canal. Panama completed a metro system in Panama City, valued at $1.2 billion in 2014. Panama's transportation and logistics services sectors, along with infrastructure development projects, have boosted economic growth; however, public debt surpassed $17 billion in 2014 because of excessive government spending and public works projects. Foreign direct investment has continued to be a source of growth. Strong economic performance has not translated into broadly shared prosperity, as Panama has the second worst income distribution in Latin America. About one-fourth of the population lives in poverty; however, from 2006 to 2012 poverty was reduced by 10 percentage points.

When the latter dissolved in 1830, Panama remained part of Colombia. With US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. In 1977, an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the subsequent decades. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama by the end of 1999. In October 2006, Panamanians approved an ambitious plan (estimated to cost $5.3 billion) to expand the Canal. The project, which began in 2007 and could double the Canal's capacity, is expected to be completed in 2016."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"PANAMA CITY (capital) 1.673 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"27.06% (male 505,079/female 484,471)","15-24 years":"17.2% (male 320,329/female 308,717)","25-54 years":"40.24% (male 745,309/female 726,211)","55-64 years":"7.55% (male 136,506/female 139,513)","65 years and over":"7.95% (male 133,930/female 156,959) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"53.4%","youth dependency ratio":"41.7%","elderly dependency ratio":"11.7%","potential support ratio":"8.5% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"600 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"81"},"Physicians density":{"value":"1.65 physicians/1,000 population (2013)"},"Languages":{"value":"Spanish (official), indigenous languages (including Ngabe, Bugle, Kuna, Embera, Wounaan, Naso Tjerdi, and Bri Bri)","note":"many Panamanians are bilingual"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 25% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"52.2% (2009)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"15,500 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"88"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-0.28 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"125"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 85%, Protestant 15%"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"10.3%","male":"8.7%","female":"13.3% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"99"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"7.2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"64"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 5.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Demographic profile":{"value":"Panama has expanded access to education and clean water, but the availability of sanitation and, to a lesser extent, electricity remains poor.
