Oil and agriculture are mainstays of Chad’s economy. Oil provides about 60% of export revenues, while cotton, cattle, livestock, and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad's non-oil export earnings. Chad relies on foreign assistance and foreign capital for much public and private sector investment. The services sector contributes about one-third of GDP and has attracted foreign investment mostly through telecommunications and banking. Chad’s fiscal position is encumbered by declining oil prices, though high oil prices and strong local harvests supported the economy in recent years. Nearly all of Chad’s fuel is provided by one domestic refinery, and unanticipated shut-downs occasionally result in shortages. The country regulates the price of domestic fuel, providing an incentive for black market sales. Chad's investment climate remains challenging due to limited infrastructure, a lack of trained workers, extensive government bureaucracy, and corruption. Chad obtained a three-year extended credit facility from the IMF in 2014 and was granted debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in April 2015."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and transportation equipment, industrial goods, foodstuffs, textiles"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"54.3%","industry":"13.2%","services":"32.4% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$1.878 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"139"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"oil, livestock, cotton, sesame, gum arabic, shea butter"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.6%","highest 10%":"30.8% (2003)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Djourab 160 m","highest point":"Emi Koussi 3,415 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"15 00 N, 19 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"43 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.88  cu km/yr (12%/12%/76%)","per capita":"84.81  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"inadequate supplies of potable water;

The government eventually drafted a democratic constitution and held flawed presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke out in northern Chad, which has sporadically flared up despite several peace agreements between the government and insurgents. In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a referendum successfully removing constitutional term limits and won another controversial election in 2006. Sporadic rebel campaigns continued throughout 2006 and 2007. The capital experienced a significant insurrection in early 2008, but has had no significant rebel threats since then, in part due to Chad's 2010 rapprochement with Sudan, which previously used Chadian rebels as proxies. DEBY in 2011 was reelected to his fourth term in an election that international observers described as proceeding without incident. In January 2014, Chad began a two-year rotation on the UN Security Council."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"N'DJAMENA (capital) 1.26 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"44.2% (male 2,607,314/female 2,534,163)","15-24 years":"20.9% (male 1,183,962/female 1,247,130)","25-54 years":"28.05% (male 1,479,285/female 1,783,014)","55-64 years":"3.87% (male 197,673/female 252,379)","65 years and over":"2.98% (male 143,712/female 202,824) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"100.7%","youth dependency ratio":"95.8%","elderly dependency ratio":"4.9%","potential support ratio":"20.3% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"11,700 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"21"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.04 physicians/1,000 population (2006)"},"Languages":{"value":"French (official), Arabic (official), Sara (in south), more than 120 different languages and dialects"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 87.9% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"4.8% (2010)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"215,000 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"25"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-3.45 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"186"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 53.1%, Catholic 20.1%, Protestant 14.2%, animist 7.3%, other 0.5%, unknown 1.7%, atheist 3.1% (1993 census)"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"3.6% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"174"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 49.2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"6.6% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"177"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Chadian(s)","adjective":"Chadian"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Sara 27.7%, Arab 12.3%, Mayo-Kebbi 11.5%, Kanem-Bornou 9%, Ouaddai 8.7%, Hadjarai 6.7%, Tandjile 6.5%, Gorane 6.3%, Fitri-Batha 4.7%, other 6.4%, unknown 0.3% (1993 census)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"0.4 beds/1,000 population (2005)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.04 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.95 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.83 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.78 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.71 male(s)/female","total population":"0.93 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"17.4 years","male":"16.4 years","female":"18.4 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"11,631,456 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"77"},"Birth rate":{"value":"36.6 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"16"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"2.3% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"160"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"30.3% (2010)","country comparison to the world":"13"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"1,475,960","percentage":"48% (2010 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"7 years","male":"9 years","female":"6 years (2011)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write French or Arabic","total population":"40.2%","male":"48.5%","female":"31.9% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"4.55 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"25"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"2.53% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"24"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"49.81 years","male":"48.64 years","female":"51.03 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"224"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"88.69 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"94.23 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"82.93 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"6"},"Death rate":{"value":"14.28 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"6"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"22.5% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"3.42% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.89% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"58"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A and E, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"malaria and dengue fever","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","respiratory disease":"meningococcal meningitis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
