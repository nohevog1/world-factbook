The area was ruled in antiquity by various Persian empires, and was conquered by Alexander the Great, Muslim armies, the Mongols, Turkic warriors, and eventually the Russians. In medieval times, Merv (located in present-day Mary province) was one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an important stop on the Silk Road. Annexed by Russia in the late 1800s, Turkmenistan later figured prominently in the anti-Bolshevik movement in Central Asia. In 1924, Turkmenistan became a Soviet republic; it achieved independence upon the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. Extensive hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves, which have yet to be fully exploited, have begun to transform the country. The Government of Turkmenistan is moving to expand its extraction and delivery projects and has attempted to diversify its gas export routes beyond Russia's pipeline network. In 2010, new gas export pipelines that carry Turkmen gas to China and to northern Iran began operating, effectively ending the Russian monopoly on Turkmen gas exports. Subsequently, decreased Russian purchases, as well as limited purchases by Iran, have made China the dominant buyer of Turkmen gas. President for Life Saparmurat NYYAZOW died in December 2006, and Turkmenistan held its first multi-candidate presidential election in February 2007. Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW, a deputy cabinet chairman under NYYAZOW, emerged as the country's new president; he was reelected in February 2012 with 97% of the vote, in an election described as \"a democratic sham.\""}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"ASHGABAT (capital) 746,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"26.14% (male 692,800/female 674,638)","15-24 years":"19.66% (male 517,312/female 510,945)","25-54 years":"42.57% (male 1,104,066/female 1,122,896)","55-64 years":"7.25% (male 178,925/female 200,502)","65 years and over":"4.38% (male 99,878/female 129,460) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"47.9%","youth dependency ratio":"41.7%","elderly dependency ratio":"6.1%","potential support ratio":"16.3% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Languages":{"value":"Turkmen (official) 72%, Russian 12%, Uzbek 9%, other 7%"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0.9% of population (2012 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"48% (2006)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-1.84 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"163"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 89%, Eastern Orthodox 9%, unknown 2%"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"190"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 28.9% of population (2012 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"18.8% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"125"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Turkmen(s)","adjective":"Turkmen"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Turkmen 85%, Uzbek 5%, Russian 4%, other 6% (2003)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"4 beds/1,000 population (2012)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.98 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.89 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.77 male(s)/female","total population":"0.98 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"27.1 years","male":"26.6 years","female":"27.5 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"5,231,422 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"120"},"Birth rate":{"value":"19.4 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"89"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"3% of GDP (2012)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"11 years","male":"11 years","female":"11 years (2014)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"99.7%","male":"99.8%","female":"99.6% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.09 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"109"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"69.78 years","male":"66.77 years","female":"72.93 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"157"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"36.82 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"44.13 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"29.14 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"60"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.13 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"158"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"50% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"1.94% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.14% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"106"}}}
