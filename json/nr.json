Few other resources exist, with most necessities being imported, mainly from Australia, its former occupier and later major source of support. Primary reserves of phosphates were exhausted and mining ceased in 2006, but mining of a deeper layer of \"secondary phosphate\" in the interior of the island began the following year. The secondary phosphate deposits may last another 30 years. Earnings from Nauruâ€™s export of phosphate remains an important source of income. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems. In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate deposits, substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru's economic future. Although revenue sources for government are limited, the opening of the Australian Regional Processing Center for asylum seekers since 2012 has sparked growth in the economy. Revenue derived from fishing licenses under the vessel day scheme has also boosted government income. Housing, hospitals, and other capital plant are deteriorating. The cost to Australia of keeping the government and economy afloat continues to climb. Few comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist with estimates of Nauru's GDP varying widely."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"food, fuel, manufactures, building materials, machinery"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"6.1%","industry":"33%","services":"60.8% (2009 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$33.3 million (2004 est.)","country comparison to the world":"196"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"phosphates"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation along plateau rim 61 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"0 32 S, 166 55 E"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"limited natural freshwater resources, roof storage tanks collect rainwater but mostly dependent on a single, aging desalination plant;
