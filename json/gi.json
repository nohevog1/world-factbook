the British garrison was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum held in 1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK led Spain to close the border and sever all communication links. Between 1997 and 2002, the UK and Spain held a series of talks on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar. In response to these talks, the Gibraltar Government called a referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since late 2004, Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar have held tripartite talks with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that affect the local population, and work continues on cooperation agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services; communications and maritime security; policy, legal and customs services; environmental protection; and education and visa services. Throughout 2009, a dispute over Gibraltar's claim to territorial waters extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols and in 2013, the British reported a record number of entries by Spanish vessels into waters claimed by Gibraltar following a dispute over Gibraltar's creation of an artificial reef in those waters. A new noncolonial constitution came into effect in 2007, and the European Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar's right to regulate its own tax regime in December 2008. The UK retains responsibility for defense, foreign relations, internal security, and financial stability."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"GIBRALTAR (capital) 29,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"20.11% (male 3,014/female 2,870)","15-24 years":"15.58% (male 2,383/female 2,174)","25-54 years":"38.44% (male 5,678/female 5,569)","55-64 years":"10.47% (male 1,418/female 1,644)","65 years and over":"15.41% (male 2,216/female 2,292) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Languages":{"value":"English (used in schools and for official purposes), Spanish, Italian, Portuguese"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-3.28 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"183"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 78.1%, Church of England 7%, Muslim 4%, other Christian 3.2%, Jewish 2.1%, Hindu 1.8%, other 0.9%, none 2.9% (2001 est.)"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Gibraltarian(s)","adjective":"Gibraltar"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Spanish, Italian, English, Maltese, Portuguese, German, North Africans"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.07 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.1 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.02 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.86 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.97 male(s)/female","total population":"1.01 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"34.2 years","male":"33.3 years","female":"35.2 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"29,258 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"219"},"Birth rate":{"value":"14.08 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"139"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"NA"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.91 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"134"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"79.28 years","male":"76.43 years","female":"82.34 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"46"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"6.16 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"6.85 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"5.42 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"164"},"Death rate":{"value":"8.37 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"83"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"100% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.07% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.24% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"180"}}}
