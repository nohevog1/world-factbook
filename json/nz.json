This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes - but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial sector. Per capita income rose for ten consecutive years until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms, but fell in 2008-09. Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half of the decade, fueling a large balance of payments deficit that posed a challenge for policymakers. Inflationary pressures caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January 2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007-08. The higher rate attracted international capital inflows, which strengthened the currency and housing market while aggravating the current account deficit. The economy fell into recession before the start of the global financial crisis and contracted for five consecutive quarters in 2008-09. In line with global peers, the central bank cut interest rates aggressively and the government developed fiscal stimulus measures. The economy pulled out of recession in 2009, and achieved 2%-3% growth between 2011 to 2014. Nevertheless, key trade sectors remain vulnerable to weak external demand and lower commodity prices. In the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes, the government has continued programs to expand export markets, develop capital markets, invest in innovation, raise productivity growth, and develop infrastructure, while easing its fiscal austerity."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$71.83 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"45"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum and products, mechanical machinery, vehicles and parts, electrical machinery, textiles"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"3.8%","industry":"26.6%","services":"69.6% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$86.89 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"50"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"dairy products, meat and edible offal, logs and wood articles, fruit, crude oil, wine"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Aoraki-Mount Cook 3,754 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"41 00 S, 174 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"327 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"4.75  cu km/yr (23%/5%/72%)","per capita":"1,200  cu m/yr (2010)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"Antarctic Seals, Marine Life Conservation"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation;

The British colony of New Zealand became an independent dominion in 1907 and supported the UK militarily in both world wars.
