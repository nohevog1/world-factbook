Growth in real output had averaged almost 4% before the global recession and it has exceeded that level in 2013-14. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication technology. Specific projects to improve the business climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's $307 million Millennium Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006. The 2001 privatization policy continues in telecommunications, water, electricity, and agriculture. An insufficient electrical supply continues to hamper Benin's economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to increase domestic power production. Private foreign direct investment is small, and foreign aid accounts for the majority of investment in infrastructure projects. Cotton, a key export, suffered from flooding in 2010-11, but high prices supported export earnings. Benin has appealed for international assistance to mitigate piracy against commercial shipping in its territory. In 2012, Benin became eligible for a second Compact under the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which is expected to be signed in 2015."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"foodstuffs, capital goods, petroleum products"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"31.8%","industry":"12.3%","services":"55.9% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$2.224 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"145"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"cotton, cashews, shea butter, textiles, palm products, seafood"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.1%","highest 10%":"29% (2003)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mont Sokbaro 658 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"9 30 N, 2 15 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"26.39 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.13  cu km/yr (32%/23%/45%)","per capita":"18.74  cu m/yr (2001)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"inadequate supplies of potable water;

KEREKOU was returned to power by elections held in 1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were alleged. KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006 and was succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni, a political outsider and independent.
