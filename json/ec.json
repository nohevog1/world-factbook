The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence between 1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of the \"Republic of the Equator.\" Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian governance in 2004, the period was marred by political instability. Protests in Quito contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of Ecuador's last four democratically elected presidents. In late 2008, voters approved a new constitution, Ecuador's 20th since gaining independence. General elections were held in February 2013, and voters reelected President Rafael CORREA."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"Guayaquil 2.709 million; QUITO (capital) 1.726 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"27.99% (male 2,265,935/female 2,175,864)","15-24 years":"18.56% (male 1,494,206/female 1,451,152)","25-54 years":"39.16% (male 3,027,989/female 3,185,924)","55-64 years":"7.23% (male 563,259/female 584,730)","65 years and over":"7.05% (male 533,796/female 585,541) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"55.6%","youth dependency ratio":"45.1%","elderly dependency ratio":"10.4%","potential support ratio":"9.6% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"1,200 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"63"},"Physicians density":{"value":"1.72 physicians/1,000 population (2011)"},"Languages":{"value":"Spanish (Castillian) 93% (official), Quechua 4.1%, other indigenous 0.7%, foreign 2.2%","note":"(Quechua and Shuar are official languages of intercultural relations; other indigenous languages are in official use by indigenous peoples in the areas they inhabit) (2010 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 15.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"32,700 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"67"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"100"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 74%, Evangelical 10.4%, Jehovah's Witness 1.2%, other 6.4% (includes Mormon Buddhist, Jewish, Spiritualist, Muslim, Hindu, indigenous religions, African American religions, Pentecostal), atheist 7.9%, agnostic 0.1%","note":"data represents persons at least 16 years of age from five Ecuadoran cities (2012 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"11.1%","male":"9%","female":"15% (2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"96"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"7.5% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"98"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 13.1% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Demographic profile":{"value":"An estimated 2 to 3 million Ecuadorians live abroad, but increased unemployment in key receiving countries - Spain, the United States, and Italy - is slowing emigration and increasing the likelihood of returnees to Ecuador.

A second, nationwide wave of emigration in the late 1990s was caused by another economic downturn, political instability, and a currency crisis. Spain was the logical destination because of its shared language and the wide availability of low-skilled, informal jobs at a time when increased border surveillance made illegal migration to the US difficult.
