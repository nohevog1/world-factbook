The industrial sector, initially dominated by steel, has become increasingly diversified to include chemicals, machinery and equipment, rubber, automotive components, and other products. The financial sector, which accounts for about 36% of GDP, is the leading sector in the economy. The economy depends on foreign and cross-border workers for about 39% of its labor force. Luxembourg experienced uneven economic growth in the aftermath of the global economic crisis that began in late 2008. Luxembourg's GDP contracted 3.6% in 2009, rebounded in 2010-12, fell again in 2013, but recovered in 2014. Unemployment has remained below the EU average despite having increased from a historically-low rate of 4% in the 2000s to 7% in 2014. The country continues to enjoy an extraordinarily high standard of living - GDP per capita ranks among the highest in the world and is the highest in the euro zone. Luxembourg has one of the highest current account surpluses as a share of GDP in the euro zone, and it maintains a healthy budgetary position and the lowest public debt levels in the region. Luxembourg has lost some of its advantage as a favorable tax location because of OECD and EU pressure. In 2015 the government’s compliance with EU requirements to implement automatic exchange of tax information on savings accounts - thus ending banking secrecy - has depressed banking activity and dampened GDP growth. Likewise, changes to the way EU members collect taxes from e-Commerce has cut Luxembourg’s tax revenues, requiring the government to raise additional levies and to reduce some direct social benefits."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$101.1 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"47"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"commercial aircraft, minerals, chemicals, metals, foodstuffs, luxury consumer goods"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"0.3%","industry":"12%","services":"87.7% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$2.084 trillion (31 December 2011)","country comparison to the world":"7"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, steel products, chemicals, rubber products, glass"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.5%","highest 10%":"23.8% (2000)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Moselle River 133 m","highest point":"Buurgplaatz 559 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"49 45 N, 6 10 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"3.1 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.06  cu km/yr (65%/33%/1%)","per capita":"135.9  cu m/yr (2010)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Environmental Modification"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"air and water pollution in urban areas, soil pollution of farmland"},"Location":{"value":"Western Europe, between France and Germany"},"Geography - note":{"value":"landlocked;
