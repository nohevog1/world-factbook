In the 1960s, GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia. In 2004, South Korea joined the trillion-dollar club of world economies. A system of close government and business ties, including directed credit and import restrictions, initially made this success possible. The government promoted the import of raw materials and technology at the expense of consumer goods, and encouraged savings and investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development model, including high debt/equity ratios and massive short-term foreign borrowing. GDP plunged by 7% in 1998, and then recovered by 9% in 1999-2000. South Korea adopted numerous economic reforms following the crisis, including greater openness to foreign investment and imports. Growth moderated to about 4% annually between 2003 and 2007. South Korea's export focused economy was hit hard by the 2008 global economic downturn, but quickly rebounded in subsequent years, reaching over 6% growth in 2010. The US-Korea Free Trade Agreement was ratified by both governments in 2011 and went into effect in March 2012. Between 2012 and 2014, the economy experienced slow growth due to sluggish domestic consumption and investment. The administration in 2015 is likely to face the challenge of balancing heavy reliance on exports with developing domestic-oriented sectors, such as services. The South Korean economy's long-term challenges include a rapidly aging population, inflexible labor market, dominance of large conglomerates (chaebols), and the heavy reliance on exports, which comprise about half of GDP.  In an effort to address the long term challenges and sustain economic growth, the current government has prioritized structural reforms, deregulation, promotion of entrepreneurship and creative industries, and the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$1.121 trillion (28 December 2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"11"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"crude oil/petroleum products, semiconductors, natural gas, coal, steel, computers, wireless communication equipment, automobiles, fine chemical, textiles"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"2.3%","industry":"38.3%","services":"59.4% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$423.5 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"28"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"semiconductors, petrochemicals, automobile/auto parts, ships, wireless communication equipment, flat display displays, steel, electronics, plastics, computers"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"6.8%","highest 10%":"37.8% (Q4 2014)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Sea of Japan 0 m","highest point":"Halla-san 1,950 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"37 00 N, 127 30 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"69.7 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"25.47  cu km/yr (26%/12%/62%)","per capita":"548.7  cu m/yr (2003)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"air pollution in large cities;

In 1910, Tokyo formally annexed the entire Peninsula. Korea regained its independence following Japan's surrender to the United States in 1945. After World War II, a democratic-based government (Republic of Korea, ROK) was set up in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula while a communist-style government was installed in the north (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, DPRK). During the Korean War (1950-53), US troops and UN forces fought alongside ROK soldiers to defend South Korea from a DPRK invasion supported by China and the Soviet Union. A 1953 armistice split the Peninsula along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. PARK Chung-hee took over leadership of the country in a 1961 coup. During his regime, from 1961 to 1979, South Korea achieved rapid economic growth, with per capita income rising to roughly 17 times the level of North Korea. South Korea held its first free presidential election under a revised democratic constitution in 1987, with former ROK Army general ROH Tae-woo winning a close race. In 1993, KIM Young-sam (1993-98) became the first civilian president of South Korea's new democratic era. President KIM Dae-jung (1998-2003) won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his contributions to South Korean democracy and his \"Sunshine\" policy of engagement with North Korea. President PARK Geun-hye, daughter of former ROK President PARK Chung-hee, took office in February 2013 and is South Korea's first female leader. South Korea held a non-permanent seat (2013-14) on the UN Security Council and will host the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Discord with North Korea has permeated inter-Korean relations for much of the past decade, highlighted by the North's attacks on a South Korean ship and island in 2010, multiple nuclear and missile tests, and a five-month closure of the inter-Korean Kaesong Industrial Complex in 2013."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"SEOUL (capital) 9.774 million; Busan (Pusan) 3.216 million; Incheon (Inch'on) 2.685 million; Daegu (Taegu) 2.244 million; Daejon (Taejon) 1.564 million; Gwangju (Kwangju) 1.536 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"13.69% (male 3,489,464/female 3,232,372)","15-24 years":"13.52% (male 3,518,488/female 3,122,997)","25-54 years":"46.63% (male 11,687,846/female 11,214,687)","55-64 years":"13.14% (male 3,190,093/female 3,264,411)","65 years and over":"13.02% (male 2,662,353/female 3,732,485) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"37.2%","youth dependency ratio":"19.2%","elderly dependency ratio":"18%","potential support ratio":"5.6% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Physicians density":{"value":"2.14 physicians/1,000 population (2012)"},"Languages":{"value":"Korean, English (widely taught in junior high and high school)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"80%","note":"percent of women aged 15-44 (2009)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"92"},"Religions":{"value":"Christian 31.6% (Protestant 24%, Roman Catholic 7.6%), Buddhist 24.2%, other or unknown 0.9%, none 43.3% (2010 survey)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"9%","male":"9.7%","female":"8.5% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"107"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"7.2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"69"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 2.2% of population (2012 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"6.3% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"139"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Korean(s)","adjective":"Korean"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"homogeneous (except for about 20,000 Chinese)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"10.3 beds/1,000 population (2009)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.07 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.08 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.13 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.98 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.71 male(s)/female","total population":"1 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"40.8 years","male":"39.2 years","female":"42.2 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"49,115,196 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"28"},"Birth rate":{"value":"8.19 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"220"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"4.9% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"75"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"0.6% (2011)","country comparison to the world":"135"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"17 years","male":"18 years","female":"16 years (2012)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.25 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"220"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"80.04 years","male":"76.95 years","female":"83.34 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"39"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"3.86 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"4.05 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"3.66 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"194"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.75 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"139"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"82.5% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.66% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.14% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"186"}}}
