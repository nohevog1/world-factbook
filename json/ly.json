Income from the sale of crude oil and natural gas, coupled with a small population, give Libya one of the highest nominal per capita GDPs in Africa, but Libya’s leaders have hindered economic development by, for the most part, failing to use these financial resources to invest in national infrastructure. Libyan sales of oil and natural gas collapsed during the Revolution of 2011, rebounded in 2012 and 2013, but then fell sharply in late 2013 and throughout 2014 due to major protest disruptions at Libyan oil ports and around the country. The state sector is large and growing, with the majority of the Libyan workforce receiving a government salary in 2014. Sharply decreased revenues and increased payments for state salaries and for subsidies on fuel and food resulted in an estimated budget deficit about 50% of GDP in 2014, up from about 4% in 2013. Libya’s economic transition away from Qadhafi’s notionally socialist model toward a market-based economy stalled as revenues shrank, political uncertainty grew, and security deteriorated. Rival political factions in late 2014 were competing for control of the central bank and the national oil company, while funding for economic reform and infrastructure projects has stopped.

Libya then passed to UN administration and achieved independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar al-QADHAFI assumed leadership and began to espouse his political system at home, which was a combination of socialism and Islam. During the 1970s, QADHAFI used oil revenues to promote his ideology outside Libya, supporting subversive and terrorist activities that included the downing of two airliners - one over Scotland, another in Northern Africa - and a discotheque bombing in Berlin. UN sanctions in 1992 isolated QADHAFI politically and economically following the attacks; sanctions were lifted in 2003 following Libyan acceptance of responsibility for the bombings and agreement to claimant compensation. QADHAFI also agreed to end Libya's program to develop weapons of mass destruction, and he made significant strides in normalizing relations with Western nations. Unrest that began in several Middle Eastern and North African countries in late 2010 erupted in Libyan cities in early 2011. QADHAFI's brutal crackdown on protesters spawned a civil war that triggered UN authorization of air and naval intervention by the international community. After months of seesaw fighting between government and opposition forces, the QADHAFI regime was toppled in mid-2011 and replaced by a transitional government. Libya in 2012 formed a new parliament and elected a new prime minister. The country subsequently elected a new parliament in 2014, but remnants of the outgoing legislature refused to leave office and created a rival government."}},"People and Society":{"Nationality":{"noun":"Libyan(s)","adjective":"Libyan"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Berber and Arab 97%, other 3% (includes Greeks, Maltese, Italians, Egyptians, Pakistanis, Turks, Indians, and Tunisians)"},"Languages":{"value":"Arabic (official), Italian, English (all widely understood in the major cities); Berber (Nafusi, Ghadamis, Suknah, Awjilah, Tamasheq)"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim (official; virtually all Sunni) 96.6%, Christian 2.7%, Buddhist 0.3%, Hindu \nnote: non-Sunni Muslims include native Ibadhi Muslims (\nreligious affiliation:\n \n          \nPopulation:\n6,411,776\nnote: immigrants make up just over 12% of the total population, according to UN data (2013) (July 2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  108\nAge structure:\n0-14 years: 26.52% (male 869,583/female 830,751)\n15-24 years: 17.77% (male 588,243/female 551,139)\n25-54 years: 46.62% (male 1,567,608/female 1,421,246)\n55-64 years: 4.97% (male 163,133/female 155,703)\n65 years and over: 4.12% (male 132,740/female 131,630) (2015 est.)\npopulation pyramid:\n \n          \nDependency ratios:\ntotal dependency ratio: 52.4%\nyouth dependency ratio: 45.5%\nelderly dependency ratio: 6.9%\npotential support ratio: 14.5% (2015 est.)\nMedian age:\ntotal: 28 years\nmale: 28.2 years\nfemale: 27.8 years (2015 est.)\nPopulation growth rate:\n2.23% (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  38\nBirth rate:\n18.03 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  104\nDeath rate:\n3.58 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  214\nNet migration rate:\n7.8 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  15\nUrbanization:\nurban population: 78.6% of total population (2015)\nrate of urbanization: 1.13% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)\nMajor urban areas - population:\nTRIPOLI (capital) 1.126 million (2015)\nSex ratio:\nat birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\n0-14 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n15-24 years: 1.07 male(s)/female\n25-54 years: 1.1 male(s)/female\n55-64 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n65 years and over: 1.01 male(s)/female\ntotal population: 1.08 male(s)/female (2015 est.)\nInfant mortality rate:\ntotal: 11.48 deaths/1,000 live births\nmale: 12.42 deaths/1,000 live births\nfemale: 10.5 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  125\nLife expectancy at birth:\ntotal population: 76.26 years\nmale: 74.54 years\nfemale: 78.06 years (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  88\nTotal fertility rate:\n2.05 children born/woman (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  113\nContraceptive prevalence rate:\n41.9% (2007)\nHealth expenditures:\n4.3% of GDP (2013)\ncountry comparison to the world:  162\nPhysicians density:\n1.9 physicians/1,000 population (2009)\nHospital bed density:\n3.7 beds/1,000 population (2012)\nDrinking water source:\nimproved: \nurban: 54.2% of population\nrural: 54.9% of population\ntotal: 54.4% of population\nunimproved: \nurban: 45.8% of population\nrural: 45.1% of population\ntotal: 45.6% of population (2001 est.)\nSanitation facility access:\nimproved: \nurban: 96.8% of population\nrural: 95.7% of population\ntotal: 96.6% of population\nunimproved: \nurban: 3.2% of population\nrural: 4.3% of population\ntotal: 3.4% of population (2015 est.)\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS:\nNA\nHIV/AIDS - deaths:\nNA\nObesity - adult prevalence rate:\n31.9% (2014)\ncountry comparison to the world:  35\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight:\n5.6% (2007)\ncountry comparison to the world:  86\nEducation expenditures:\nNA\nLiteracy:\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 91%\nmale: 96.7%\nfemale: 85.6% (2015 est.)\n"}}}
