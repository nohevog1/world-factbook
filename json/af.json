The economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international assistance, the recovery of the agricultural sector, and service sector growth. Despite the progress of the past few years, Afghanistan is extremely poor, landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid. Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity, medical care, and jobs. Criminality, insecurity, weak governance, lack of infrastructure, and the Afghan Government's difficulty in extending rule of law to all parts of the country pose challenges to future economic growth. Afghanistan's living standards are among the lowest in the world. The international community remains committed to Afghanistan's development, pledging over $67 billion at nine donors' conferences between 2003-10. In July 2012, the donors at the Tokyo conference pledged an additional $16 billion in civilian aid through 2015. Despite this help, the Government of Afghanistan will need to overcome a number of challenges, including low revenue collection, anemic job creation, high levels of corruption, weak government capacity, and poor public infrastructure. Afghanistan's growth rate slowed markedly in 2014. Newly elected President Ashraf GHANI is dedicated to instituting economic reforms. However, the drawdown of international security forces that occurred in 2014 will negatively affect economic growth, as a substantial portion of commerce, especially in the services sector, has catered to the ongoing international troop presence in the country."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and other capital goods, food, textiles, petroleum products"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"24.6%","industry":"21.8%","services":"53.5%","note":"data exclude opium production (2012 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$2.7 billion (FY08/09)","country comparison to the world":"157"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"opium, fruits and nuts, handwoven carpets, wool, cotton, hides and pelts, precious and semi-precious gems"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.8%","highest 10%":"24% (2008)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Amu Darya 258 m","highest point":"Noshak 7,485 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"33 00 N, 65 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"65.33 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"20.28  cu km/yr (1%/1%/98%)","per capita":"823.1  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection","signed, but not ratified":"Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"limited natural freshwater resources;

In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and the National Assembly was inaugurated the following December. KARZAI was reelected in August 2009 for a second term. Despite gains toward building a stable central government, a resurgent Taliban and continuing provincial instability - particularly in the south and the east - remain serious challenges for the Afghan Government. The 2014 presidential election was the country's first to include a runoff, which featured the top two vote-getters from the first round, Abdullah ABDULLAH and Ashraf GHANI. Throughout the summer of 2014, their campaigns disputed the results and traded accusations of fraud, leading to a US-led diplomatic intervention that included a full vote audit as well as political negotiations between the two camps. In September 2014, GHANI and ABDULLAH agreed to form the Government of National Unity, with GHANI inaugurated as President and ABDULLAH elevated to the newly-created position of Chief Executive Officer. The day after the inauguration, the Ghani administration signed the US-Afghan Bilateral Security Agreement and NATO Status of Forces Agreement, which provide the legal basis for the post-2014 international military presence in Afghanistan."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"KABUL (capital) 4.635 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"41.47% (male 6,861,021/female 6,644,780)","15-24 years":"22.41% (male 3,716,738/female 3,579,701)","25-54 years":"29.69% (male 4,928,181/female 4,741,601)","55-64 years":"3.88% (male 621,970/female 641,307)","65 years and over":"2.55% (male 384,267/female 444,776) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"87%","youth dependency ratio":"82.3%","elderly dependency ratio":"4.6%","potential support ratio":"21.7% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"97"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.27 physicians/1,000 population (2013)"},"Languages":{"value":"Afghan Persian or Dari (official) 50%, Pashto (official) 35%, Turkic languages (primarily Uzbek and Turkmen) 11%, 30 minor languages (primarily Balochi and Pashai) 4%, much bilingualism, but Dari functions as the lingua franca","note":"the Turkic languages Uzbek and Turkmen, as well as Balochi, Pashai, Nuristani, and Pamiri are the third official languages in areas where the majority speaks them"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 68.1% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"21.2% (2010/11)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"6,700 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"105"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-1.51 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"156"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 99.7% (Sunni 84.7 - 89.7%, Shia 10 - 15%), other 0.3% (2009 est.)"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"8.1% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"46"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 44.7% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"2.4% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"182"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Afghan(s)","adjective":"Afghan"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek, other (includes smaller numbers of Baloch, Turkmen, Nuristani, Pamiri, Arab, Gujar, Brahui, Qizilbash, Aimaq, Pashai, and Kyrghyz)","note":"current statistical data on the sensitive subject of ethnicity in Afghanistan is not available, and ethnicity data from small samples of respondents to opinion polls are not a reliable alternative;
