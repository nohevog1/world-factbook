The government has been pursuing large-scale reconstruction and development projects in its efforts to spur growth in war-torn and disadvantaged areas, develop small and medium enterprises and increase agricultural productivity. The government's high debt payments and bloated civil service have contributed to historically high budget deficits, but fiscal consolidation efforts and strong GDP growth in recent years have helped bring down the government's fiscal deficit, but low tax revenues remain a concern. The 2008-09 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka's economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments crisis. Agriculture slowed due to a drought and weak global demand affected exports and trade. In early 2012, Sri Lanka floated the rupee, resulting in a sharp depreciation, and took steps to curb imports. A large trade deficit remains a concern, but strong remittances from Sri Lankan workers abroad help offset the trade deficit.

Buddhism was introduced in about the mid-third century B.C., and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura (kingdom from circa 200 B.C. to circa A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In the 14th century, a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom in northern Sri Lanka. The Portuguese controlled the coastal areas of the island in the 16th century and the Dutch in the 17th century. The island was ceded to the British in 1796, became a crown colony in 1802, and was formally united under British rule by 1815. As Ceylon, it became independent in 1948; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972. Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983. After two decades of fighting, the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) formalized a cease-fire in February 2002 with Norway brokering peace negotiations. Violence between the LTTE and government forces intensified in 2006, but the government regained control of the Eastern Province in 2007 and by May 2009, the remnants of the LTTE had been defeated. Since the end of the conflict, the government has enacted an ambitious program of economic development projects, many of which are financed by loans from the Government of China. In addition to efforts at reconstructing its economy, the government has resettled more than 95% of those civilians displaced during the final phase of the conflict and released the vast majority of former LTTE combatants captured by Government Security Forces. At the same time, there has been little progress on more contentious and politically difficult issues such as reaching a political settlement with Tamil elected representatives and holding accountable those alleged to have been involved in human rights violations and other abuses during the conflict."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte (legislative capital) 128,000 (2014); COLOMBO (capital) 707,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"24.58% (male 2,764,848/female 2,655,218)","15-24 years":"14.77% (male 1,652,884/female 1,604,089)","25-54 years":"41.9% (male 4,523,146/female 4,718,156)","55-64 years":"9.72% (male 992,750/female 1,149,828)","65 years and over":"9.04% (male 847,805/female 1,144,764) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"51.2%","youth dependency ratio":"37.2%","elderly dependency ratio":"14.1%","potential support ratio":"7.1% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"100 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"127"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.68 physicians/1,000 population (2010)"},"Languages":{"value":"Sinhala (official and national language) 74%, Tamil (national language) 18%, other 8%","note":"English, spoken competently by about 10% of the population, is commonly used in government and is referred to as the link language in the constitution"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 4.9% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"68.4% (2006/07)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"3,300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"113"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-1.35 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"154"},"Religions":{"value":"Buddhist (official) 70.2%, Hindu 12.6%, Muslim 9.7%, Roman Catholic 6.1%, other Christian 1.3%, other 0.05% (2012 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"17.3%","male":"14%","female":"23.5% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"69"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"3.2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"177"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 4.4% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"6.8% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"155"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Sri Lankan(s)","adjective":"Sri Lankan"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Sinhalese 74.9%, Sri Lankan Tamil 11.2%, Sri Lankan Moors 9.2%, Indian Tamil 4.2%, other 0.5% (2012 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"3.6 beds/1,000 population (2012)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.04 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.96 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.86 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.74 male(s)/female","total population":"0.96 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"32.1 years","male":"30.9 years","female":"33.3 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"22,053,488 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"57"},"Birth rate":{"value":"15.85 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"124"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"1.7% of GDP (2012)","country comparison to the world":"168"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"26.3% (2012)","country comparison to the world":"23"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"14 years","male":"13 years","female":"14 years (2012)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"92.6%","male":"93.6%","female":"91.7% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.1 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"106"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.03% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"127"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"76.56 years","male":"73.06 years","female":"80.19 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"84"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"8.8 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"9.75 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"7.82 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"146"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.11 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"159"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"18.4% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.72% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.84% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"131"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial diarrhea and hepatitis A","vectorborne disease":"dengue fever","water contact disease":"leptospirosis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
