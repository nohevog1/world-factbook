Islamic Mahdist revolutionaries overran the region in 1885, but in 1898 a British force was able to overthrow the Mahdist regime. An Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was established the following year with Equatoria being the southernmost of its eight provinces. The isolated region was largely left to itself over the following decades, but Christian missionaries converted much of the population and facilitated the spread of English. When Sudan gained its independence in 1956, it was with the understanding that the southerners would be able to participate fully in the political system. When the Arab Khartoum government reneged on its promises, a mutiny began that led to two prolonged periods of conflict (1955-1972 and 1983-2005) in which perhaps 2.5 million people died - mostly civilians - due to starvation and drought. Ongoing peace talks finally resulted in a Comprehensive Peace Agreement, signed in January 2005. As part of this agreement, the south was granted a six-year period of autonomy to be followed by a referendum on final status. The result of this referendum, held in January 2011, was a vote of 98% in favor of secession. Since independence on 9 July 2011, South Sudan has struggled with good governance and nation building and has attempted to control rebel militia groups operating in its territory. Economic conditions have deteriorated since January 2012 when the government decided to shut down oil production following bilateral disagreements with Sudan."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"JUBA (capital) 321,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"45.34% (male 2,783,904/female 2,676,370)","15-24 years":"20.08% (male 1,274,328/female 1,144,181)","25-54 years":"29.25% (male 1,701,044/female 1,821,277)","55-64 years":"3.23% (male 210,231/female 179,076)","65 years and over":"2.1% (male 140,993/female 111,506) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"83.7%","youth dependency ratio":"77.3%","elderly dependency ratio":"6.4%","potential support ratio":"15.7% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"12,700 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"19"},"Languages":{"value":"English (official), Arabic (includes Juba and Sudanese variants), regional languages include Dinka, Nuer, Bari, Zande, Shilluk"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 93.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"4% (2010)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"193,400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"31"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"11.47 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"9"},"Religions":{"value":"animist, Christian"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"2.2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"186"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 41.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"6.6% (2014)"},"Nationality":{"noun":"South Sudanese (singular and plural)","adjective":"South Sudanese"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Dinka 35.8%, Nuer 15.6%, Shilluk, Azande, Bari, Kakwa, Kuku, Murle, Mandari, Didinga, Ndogo, Bviri, Lndi, Anuak, Bongo, Lango, Dungotona, Acholi (2011 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"17 years","male":"16.8 years","female":"17.1 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"12,042,910 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"75"},"Birth rate":{"value":"36.91 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"15"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"0.7% of GDP (2011)"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"27.6% (2010)","country comparison to the world":"10"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"27%","male":"40%","female":"16% (2009 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"5.31 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"11"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"2.71% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"23"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"66.39 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"71.05 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"61.49 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"16"},"Death rate":{"value":"8.18 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"91"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"18.8% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"5.05% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"4.02% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"1"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne disease":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A and E, and typhoid fever","vectorborne disease":"malaria, dengue fever, trypanosomiasis-Gambiense (African sleeping sickness)","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","respiratory disease":"meningococcal meningitis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
