Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland became an integral part of the Danish Realm in 1953. It joined the European Community (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985 over a dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland was granted self-government in 1979 by the Danish parliament; the law went into effect the following year. Greenland voted in favor of increased self-rule in November 2008 and acquired greater responsibility for internal affairs when the Act on Greenland Self-Government was signed into law in June 2009. Denmark, however, continues to exercise control over several policy areas on behalf of Greenland, including foreign affairs, security, and financial policy in consultation with Greenland's Self-Rule Government."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"NUUK (capital) 17,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"21.35% (male 6,263/female 6,064)","15-24 years":"16.2% (male 4,736/female 4,615)","25-54 years":"42.03% (male 12,751/female 11,516)","55-64 years":"11.87% (male 3,858/female 2,996)","65 years and over":"8.55% (male 2,640/female 2,294) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Physicians density":{"value":"1.67 physicians/1,000 population (2009)"},"Languages":{"value":"Greenlandic (East Inuit) (official), Danish (official), English"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-5.98 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"198"},"Religions":{"value":"Evangelical Lutheran, traditional Inuit spiritual beliefs"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Nationality":{"noun":"Greenlander(s)","adjective":"Greenlandic"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Inuit 88%, Danish and other 12% (2010 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"5.8 beds/1,000 population (2009)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.11 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1.29 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"1.15 male(s)/female","total population":"1.1 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"33.7 years","male":"34.9 years","female":"32.5 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"57,733 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"206"},"Birth rate":{"value":"14.48 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"135"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.03 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"118"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"72.1 years","male":"69.41 years","female":"74.92 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"144"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"9.23 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"10.54 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"7.85 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"143"},"Death rate":{"value":"8.49 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"77"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"86.4% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.74% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"196"}}}
