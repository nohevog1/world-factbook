Economic policy is focused on sustaining Qatar's nonassociated natural gas reserves and increasing private and foreign investment in non-energy sectors, but oil and gas still account for roughly 92% of export earnings, and 62% of government revenues. Oil and gas have made Qatar the world's highest per-capita income country and the country with the lowest unemployment. Proved oil reserves in excess of 25 billion barrels should enable continued output at current levels for about 56 years. Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas exceed 25 trillion cubic meters, about 13% of the world total and third largest in the world. Qatar's successful 2022 World Cup bid is accelerating large-scale infrastructure projects such as Qatar's metro system, light rail system, the construction of a new port, roads, stadiums and related sporting infrastructure.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Qatari economy was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum revenues by the amir, who had ruled the country since 1972. His son, HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani, overthrew the father in a bloodless coup in 1995. In short order, HAMAD oversaw the creation of the pan-Arab satellite news network Al-Jazeera and Qatar's pursuit of a leadership role in mediating regional conflicts. In the 2000s, Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. As of 2007, oil and natural gas revenues had enabled Qatar to attain the highest per capita income in the world. Qatar has not experienced domestic unrest or violence like that seen in other Near Eastern and North African countries in 2010-11, due in part to its immense wealth. Since the outbreak of regional unrest, however, Doha has prided itself on its support for many of these popular revolutions, particularly in Libya and Syria. In mid-2013, HAMAD transferred power to his 33 year-old son, the current Amir TAMIM bin Hamad - a peaceful abdication rare in the history of Arab Gulf states. TAMIM has prioritized improving the domestic welfare of Qataris, including establishing advanced healthcare and education systems and expanding the country's infrastructure in anticipation of Doha's hosting of the 2022 World Cup."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"DOHA (capital) 718,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"12.52% (male 139,353/female 135,514)","15-24 years":"12.96% (male 207,493/female 76,879)","25-54 years":"70.23% (male 1,278,442/female 263,051)","55-64 years":"3.39% (male 57,581/female 16,886)","65 years and over":"0.89% (male 12,365/female 7,253) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"20.1%","youth dependency ratio":"18.6%","elderly dependency ratio":"1.4%","potential support ratio":"70.4% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Physicians density":{"value":"7.74 physicians/1,000 population (2010)"},"Languages":{"value":"Arabic (official), English commonly used as a second language"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"38% (2012)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"22.39 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"1"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 77.5%, Christian 8.5%, other (includes mainly Hindu and other Indian religions) 14% (2004 est.)","religious affiliation":" "},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"1.3%","male":"0.4%","female":"8.9% (2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"134"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"2.2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"189"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"41% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"16"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Qatari(s)","adjective":"Qatari"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Arab 40%, Indian 18%, Pakistani 18%, Iranian 10%, other 14%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"1.2 beds/1,000 population (2012)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.02 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"2.7 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"4.86 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"3.41 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"1.71 male(s)/female","total population":"3.39 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"32.8 years","male":"33.9 years","female":"28.1 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"2,194,817 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"144"},"Birth rate":{"value":"9.84 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"199"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"2.4% of GDP (2008)","country comparison to the world":"154"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"14 years","male":"14 years","female":"14 years (2005)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"97.3%","male":"97.4%","female":"96.8% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.91 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"137"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"78.59 years","male":"76.58 years","female":"80.65 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"53"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"6.32 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"6.61 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"6.02 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"163"},"Death rate":{"value":"1.53 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"225"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"99.2% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"6.02% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"3.07% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"6"}}}
