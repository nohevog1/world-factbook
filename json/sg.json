Senegal relies heavily on donor assistance, remittances and foreign direct investment. President Macky SALL, who was elected in March 2012 under a reformist policy agenda, inherited an economy with high energy costs, a challenging business environment, and a culture of overspending. Senegal received technical support from the IMF in 2010-2014 under a Policy Support Instrument to assist economic reform through sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies to reduce the fiscal deficit, increase transparency and facilitate private investment. President SALL unveiled an ambitious economic plan, the Emerging Senegal Plan, which aims to implement priority economic reforms and investment projects to increase economic growth. Bureaucratic bottlenecks and a challenging business climate are among the perennial challenges that may slow the implementation of this plan.

The union broke up after only a few months. Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982. The envisaged integration of the two countries was never implemented, and the union was dissolved in 1989. The Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance has led a low-level separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s, and several peace deals have failed to resolve the conflict. Nevertheless, Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa and has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping and regional mediation. Senegal was ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until Abdoulaye WADE was elected president in 2000. He was reelected in 2007 and during his two terms amended Senegal's constitution over a dozen times to increase executive power and weaken the opposition. His decision to run for a third presidential term sparked a large public backlash that led to his defeat in a March 2012 runoff election with Macky SALL, a former ally and prime minister. Since taking office, SALL has launched an economic reform program aimed at boosting economic growth, and his administration has conducted corruption investigations against senior figures in WADE's government."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"DAKAR (capital) 3.52 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"42.16% (male 2,960,395/female 2,931,298)","15-24 years":"20.4% (male 1,420,180/female 1,431,571)","25-54 years":"30.67% (male 1,960,745/female 2,325,620)","55-64 years":"3.84% (male 233,892/female 303,394)","65 years and over":"2.92% (male 184,196/female 224,543) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"87.6%","youth dependency ratio":"82.1%","elderly dependency ratio":"5.5%","potential support ratio":"18.2% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"2,400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"52"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.06 physicians/1,000 population (2008)"},"Languages":{"value":"French (official), Wolof, Pulaar, Jola, Mandinka"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 52.4% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"17.8% (2012/13)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"44,000 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"58"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-1.59 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"159"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 94% (most adhere to one of the four main Sufi brotherhoods), Christian 5% (mostly Roman Catholic), indigenous beliefs 1%"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"14.8%","male":"11.9%","female":"20.1% (2006 est.)","country comparison to the world":"77"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"4.2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"141"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 21.5% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"8.3% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"145"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Senegalese (singular and plural)","adjective":"Senegalese"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Wolof 43.3%, Pular 23.8%, Serer 14.7%, Jola 3.7%, Mandinka 3%, Soninke 1.1%, European and Lebanese 1%, other 9.4%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"0.3 beds/1,000 population (2008)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.99 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.84 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.77 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.82 male(s)/female","total population":"0.94 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"18.5 years","male":"17.7 years","female":"19.4 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"13,975,834 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"73"},"Birth rate":{"value":"34.52 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"24"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"5.6% of GDP (2010)","country comparison to the world":"53"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"16.8% (2013)","country comparison to the world":"40"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"657,216","percentage":"22% (2005 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"8 years","male":"8 years","female":"8 years (2010)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"57.7%","male":"69.7%","female":"46.6% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"4.44 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"30"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.53% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"66"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"61.32 years","male":"59.29 years","female":"63.42 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"195"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"51.54 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"57.62 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"45.29 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"34"},"Death rate":{"value":"8.46 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"78"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"43.7% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"3.59% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"2.45% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"29"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"dengue fever, malaria, and yellow fever","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","respiratory disease":"meningococcal meningitis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
