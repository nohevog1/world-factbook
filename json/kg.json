Other exports include gold, mercury, uranium, natural gas, and — in some years — electricity. Bishkek remains embroiled in a legal battle with Canadian investors in the Kumtor gold mine, the nation’s largest. Kyrgyzstan has sought foreign investment to develop hydroelectric potential as a source of export revenue. The economy also depends heavily on remittances from Kyrgyzstani migrant workers, primarily in Russia. Following independence, Kyrgyzstan rapidly carried out market reforms, such as improving the regulatory system and instituting land reform. Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. The government has sold much of its ownership shares in enterprises. Drops in production had been severe after the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995, production began to recover and exports began to increase. The overthrow of President BAKIEV in April 2010 and subsequent ethnic clashes left hundreds dead and damaged infrastructure. Under President ATAMBAEV, Kyrgyzstan has developed a plan for economic development in coordination with international donors. In December 2014 Kyrgyzstan agreed to join the Eurasian Economic Union in early 2015. The keys to future growth include progress in fighting corruption, improving administrative transparency, restructuring domestic industry, and attracting foreign aid and investment."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$79 million (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"118"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"oil and gas, machinery and equipment, chemicals, foodstuffs"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"19.3%","industry":"31.1%","services":"49.6% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$6.376 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"119"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"gold, cotton, wool, garments, meat, tobacco;

The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of President Askar AKAEV, who had run the country since 1990. Former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV overwhelmingly won the presidential election in the summer of 2005. Over the next few years, he manipulated the parliament to accrue new powers for the presidency. In July 2009, after months of harassment against his opponents and media critics, BAKIEV won reelection in a presidential campaign that the international community deemed flawed. In April 2010, violent protests in Bishkek led to the collapse of the BAKIEV regime and his eventual flight to Minsk, Belarus. His successor, Roza OTUNBAEVA, served as transitional president until Almazbek ATAMBAEV was inaugurated in December 2011, marking the first peaceful transfer of presidential power in independent Kyrgyzstan's history. Continuing concerns include: the trajectory of democratization, endemic corruption, poor interethnic relations, and terrorism."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"BISHKEK (capital) 865,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"29.92% (male 867,668/female 827,235)","15-24 years":"18.18% (male 523,347/female 506,453)","25-54 years":"39.55% (male 1,096,430/female 1,144,265)","55-64 years":"7.34% (male 180,874/female 234,733)","65 years and over":"5.01% (male 108,776/female 175,158) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"55.3%","youth dependency ratio":"48.8%","elderly dependency ratio":"6.6%","potential support ratio":"15.2% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"95"},"Physicians density":{"value":"1.97 physicians/1,000 population (2013)"},"Languages":{"value":"Kyrgyz (official) 71.4%, Uzbek 14.4%, Russian (official) 9%, other 5.2% (2009 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 6.7% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"36.3% (2012)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"9,300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"95"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-5.22 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"194"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 75%, Russian Orthodox 20%, other 5%"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"14.6%","male":"13.6%","female":"16.2% (2006 est.)","country comparison to the world":"80"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"6.7% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"77"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 10% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"13.3% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"118"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Kyrgyzstani(s)","adjective":"Kyrgyzstani"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Kyrgyz 70.9%, Uzbek 14.3%, Russian 7.7%, Dungan 1.1%, other 5.9% (includes Uyghur, Tajik, Turk, Kazakh, Tatar, Ukrainian, Korean, German) (2009 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"4.8 beds/1,000 population (2012)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.07 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.96 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.77 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.62 male(s)/female","total population":"0.96 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"26 years","male":"25 years","female":"27 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"5,664,939 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"115"},"Birth rate":{"value":"22.98 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"68"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"6.8% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"25"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"2.8% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"101"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"563,920","percentage":"40.3%","note":"data represents children ages 5-17 (2007 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"13 years","male":"12 years","female":"13 years (2011)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"99.5%","male":"99.6%","female":"99.4% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.66 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"73"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.26% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"92"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"70.36 years","male":"66.19 years","female":"74.8 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"155"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"27.73 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"31.94 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"23.24 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"67"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.65 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"142"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"35.7% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"1.58% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.11% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"109"}}}
