The country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The country remains dependent on external aid and remittances from overseas Tongans to offset its trade deficit. Tourism is the second-largest source of hard currency earnings following remittances. Tonga had 39,000 visitors in 2006. The government is emphasizing the development of the private sector, encouraging investment, and is committing increased funds for health and education. Tonga's English-speaking and educated workforce offer a viable labor market, and the tropical climate provides fertile soil. Renewable energy and deep sea mining also offer opportunities for investment. Tonga has a reasonably sound basic infrastructure and well developed social services. The government faces high unemployment among the young, moderate inflation, pressures for democratic reform, and rising civil service expenditures."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"foodstuffs, machinery and transport equipment, fuels, chemicals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"18.1%","industry":"21.1%","services":"60.8% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$196.5 million (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"188"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"squash, fish, vanilla beans, root crops"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation on Kao Island 1,033 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"20 00 S, 175 00 W"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation results as more and more land is being cleared for agriculture and settlement;
