The government controls key areas, such as the vital petroleum sector, through extensive regulation and large-scale state-majority-owned enterprises. The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on the petroleum sector, which accounts for the largest portion of export revenue and about 30% of government revenue. Norway is the world's third-largest natural gas exporter; and seventh largest oil exporter, making one of its largest offshore oil finds in 2011. Norway opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994; nonetheless, as a member of the European Economic Area, it contributes sizably to the EU budget. In anticipation of eventual declines in oil and gas production, Norway saves state revenue from the petroleum sector in the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, valued at over $870 billion in December 2014 and annually uses up to 4% of the fund, itâ€™s projected long term return, to help finance public expenses. After solid GDP growth in 2004-07, the economy slowed in 2008, and contracted in 2009, before returning to positive growth in 2010-14. Nevertheless, the government budget remains in surplus. Lower oil prices in 2015 may cause the economy to contract as higher costs production costs in the North Sea deter investment."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$250.9 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"33"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, chemicals, metals, foodstuffs"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"1.7%","industry":"41.8%","services":"56.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$595.7 billion (31 December 2011)","note":"Norway is a net external creditor","country comparison to the world":"19"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum and petroleum products, machinery and equipment, metals, chemicals, ships, fish"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.9%","highest 10%":"21% (2008)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Norwegian Sea 0 m","highest point":"Galdhopiggen 2,469 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"62 00 N, 10 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"382 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"2.94  cu km/yr (28%/43%/29%)","per capita":"622.4  cu m/yr (2006)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"water pollution;

conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In 1949, Norway abandoned neutrality and became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU.
