Livestock, hides, fish, charcoal, and bananas are Somalia's principal exports, while sugar, sorghum, corn, qat, and machined goods are the principal imports. Somalia's small industrial sector, based on the processing of agricultural products, has largely been looted and the machinery sold as scrap metal. Telecommunication firms provide wireless services in most major cities and offer the lowest international call rates on the continent. Mogadishu's main market offers a variety of goods from food to electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to operate and are supported with private-security militias. Somalia's government lacks the ability to collect domestic revenue, and arrears to the IMF have continued to grow. Somalia's capital city - Mogadishu - has witnessed the development of the city's first gas stations, supermarkets, and flights between Europe (Istanbul-Mogadishu) since the collapse of central authority in 1991. This economic growth has yet to expand outside of Mogadishu, and within the city, security concerns dominate business. In the absence of a formal banking sector, money transfer/remittance services have sprouted throughout the country, handling up to $1.6 billion in remittances annually, although international concerns over the money transfers into Somalia currently threatens these services."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"manufactures, petroleum products, foodstuffs, construction materials, qat"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"60.2%","industry":"7.4%","services":"32.5% (2011 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$3.055 billion (31 December 2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"140"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"livestock, bananas, hides, fish, charcoal, scrap metal"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Shimbiris 2,416 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"10 00 N, 49 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"14.7 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"3.3  cu km/yr (0%/0%/100%)","per capita":"377.6  cu m/yr (2003)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"famine;

In 1969, a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre ushered in an authoritarian socialist rule characterized by the persecution, jailing, and torture of political opponents and dissidents. After the regime's collapse early in 1991, Somalia descended into turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy. In May 1991, northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although not recognized by any government, this entity has maintained a stable existence and continues efforts to establish a constitutional democracy, including holding municipal, parliamentary, and presidential elections. The regions of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring semi-autonomous state of Puntland, which has been self-governing since 1998 but does not aim at independence; it has also made strides toward reconstructing a legitimate, representative government but has suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its border with Somaliland as it also claims the regions of Sool and Sanaag, and portions of Togdheer. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily in south-central Somalia) was able to alleviate famine conditions, but when the UN withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant casualties, order still had not been restored. In 2000, the Somalia National Peace Conference (SNPC) held in Djibouti resulted in the formation of an interim government, known as the Transitional National Government (TNG). When the TNG failed to establish adequate security or governing institutions, the Government of Kenya, under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), led a subsequent peace process that concluded in October 2004 with the election of Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as President of a second interim government, known as the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of the Somali Republic. The TFG included a 275-member parliamentary body, known as the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP). President YUSUF resigned late in 2008 while United Nations-sponsored talks between the TFG and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) were underway in Djibouti. In January 2009, following the creation of a TFG-ARS unity government, Ethiopian military forces, which had entered Somalia in December 2006 to support the TFG in the face of advances by the opposition Islamic Courts Union (ICU), withdrew from the country. The TFP was doubled in size to 550 seats with the addition of 200 ARS and 75 civil society members of parliament. The expanded parliament elected Sheikh SHARIF Sheikh Ahmed, the former ICU and ARS chairman as president in January 2009. The creation of the TFG was based on the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC), which outlined a five-year mandate leading to the establishment of a new Somali constitution and a transition to a representative government following national elections. In 2009, the TFP amended the TFC to extend TFG's mandate until 2011 and in 2011 Somali principals agreed to institute political transition by August 2012. The transition process ended in September 2012 when clan elders replaced the TFP by appointing 275 members to a new parliament who subsequently elected a new president."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"MOGADISHU (capital) 2.138 million; Hargeysa 760,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"43.72% (male 2,317,935/female 2,323,681)","15-24 years":"18.85% (male 1,012,447/female 988,251)","25-54 years":"31.36% (male 1,722,230/female 1,607,117)","55-64 years":"3.83% (male 196,664/female 209,983)","65 years and over":"2.24% (male 92,658/female 145,414) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"98.1%","youth dependency ratio":"92.5%","elderly dependency ratio":"5.6%","potential support ratio":"17.9% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"2,400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"54"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.04 physicians/1,000 population (2006)"},"Languages":{"value":"Somali (official), Arabic (official, according to the Transitional Federal Charter), Italian, English"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 76.4% of population (2011 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"14.6% (2006)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"34,900 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"65"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-8.49 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"211"},"Religions":{"value":"Sunni Muslim (Islam) (official, according to the Transitional Federal Charter)"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 68.3% of population (2011 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"3.9% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"162"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Somali(s)","adjective":"Somali"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Somali 85%, Bantu and other non-Somali 15% (including 30,000 Arabs)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.02 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.07 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.94 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.64 male(s)/female","total population":"1.01 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"17.8 years","male":"18 years","female":"17.7 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"10,616,380","note":"this estimate was derived from an official census taken in 1975 by the Somali Government; population counting in Somalia is complicated by the large number of nomads and by refugee movements in response to famine and clan warfare (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"86"},"Birth rate":{"value":"40.45 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"8"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"NA"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"32.8% (2006)","country comparison to the world":"9"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"1,148,265","percentage":"49% (2006 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"5.99 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"4"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.55% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"63"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"51.96 years","male":"49.93 years","female":"54.06 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"218"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"98.39 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"107.07 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"89.45 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"3"},"Death rate":{"value":"13.62 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"13"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"39.6% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"4.06% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.83% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"62"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A and E, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"dengue fever, malaria, and Rift Valley fever","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
