Only eight of the atolls are inhabited. It is one of the smallest countries in the world, with its highest point at 4.6 meters above sea level. The country is isolated, almost entirely dependent on imports, particularly of food and fuel, and vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels, which pose significant challenges to development. The public sector dominates economic activity. Tuvalu has few natural resources, except for its fisheries. Earnings from fish exports and fishing licenses for Tuvaluâ€™s territorial waters are a significant source of government revenue. In 2013, revenue from fishing licenses doubled and totaled more than 45% of GDP. Official aid from foreign development partners has also increased. Tuvalu has substantial assets abroad. The Tuvalu Trust Fund, an international trust fund established in 1987 by development partners, has grown to $141 million in 2013 and is an important cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government's budget. While remittances are another substantial source of income, the value of remittances has declined since the global financial crisis of 2008. Growing income inequality is one of many concerns for the nation."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$0 (2014)"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"food, animals, mineral fuels, machinery, manufactured goods"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"24.5%","industry":"5.6%","services":"70% (2012 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$NA"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"copra, fish"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"unnamed location 5 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"8 00 S, 178 00 E"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"since there are no streams or rivers and groundwater is not potable, most water needs must be met by catchment systems with storage facilities;
