The economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six commodities - sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice - which represent nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. Guyana's entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) in January 2006 has broadened the country's export market, primarily in the raw materials sector. Guyana has experienced positive growth almost every year over the past decade. Inflation has been kept under control. Recent years have seen the government's stock of debt reduced significantly - with external debt now less than half of what it was in the early 1990s. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled labor and a deficient infrastructure. Despite recent improvements, the government is still juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank, Guyana's principal donor, canceled Guyana's nearly $470 million debt, equivalent to 21% of GDP, which along with other Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt forgiveness, brought the debt-to-GDP ratio down from 183% in 2006 to 58% in 2014. Guyana had become heavily indebted as a result of the inward-looking, state-led development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s. Much of Guyana's growth in recent years has come from a surge in gold production in response to global prices, although downward trends in gold prices may threaten future growth. In 2014, production of sugar dropped to a 24-year low."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$339.8 million (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"111"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"manufactures, machinery, petroleum, food"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"20.3%","industry":"39.2%","services":"40.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$1.846 billion (31 December 2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"148"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"sugar, gold, bauxite, alumina, rice, shrimp, molasses, rum, timber"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"1.3%","highest 10%":"33.8% (1999)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mount Roraima 2,835 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"5 00 N, 59 00 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"241 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"1.64  cu km/yr (4%/1%/94%)","per capita":"2,222  cu m/yr (2010)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"water pollution from sewage and agricultural and industrial chemicals;

Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966, and since then it has been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was elected president in what is considered the country's first free and fair election since independence. After his death five years later, his wife, Janet JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to poor health. Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was reelected in 2001 and again in 2006.
