Gas accounts for roughly 50% of Bolivia's total exports and will fund more than half of its 2015 budget. However, the country remains one of the least developed countries in Latin America because of state-oriented policies that deter investment and growth. Following a disastrous economic crisis during the early 1980s, reforms spurred private investment, stimulated economic growth, and cut poverty rates in the 1990s. The period 2003-05 was characterized by political instability, racial tensions, and violent protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large Northern Hemisphere markets. In 2005, the government passed a controversial hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange for a predetermined service fee. The global recession slowed growth, but Bolivia recorded the highest growth rate in South America during 2009 and has averaged 5.3% growth each year since 2009. High commodity prices since 2010 sustained rapid growth and large trade surpluses. However, a lack of foreign investment in the key sectors of mining and hydrocarbons, along with conflict among social groups pose challenges for the Bolivian economy. President Evo MORALES passed an investment law and promised not to nationalize additional industries in an effort to improve Bolivia's investment climate. The global decline in oil prices in late 2014 exerted downward pressure on the price Bolivia receives for exported gas and may result in lower GDP growth rates and losses in government revenue in 2015."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$6.089 billion (31 December 2011)","country comparison to the world":"75"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery, petroleum products, vehicles, iron and steel, plastics"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"13.1%","industry":"38.9%","services":"48% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$7.734 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"108"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"natural gas, mineral ores, gold, soybeans and soy products, tin"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"0.8%","highest 10%":"33.6% (2012 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Rio Paraguay 90 m","highest point":"Nevado Sajama 6,542 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"17 00 S, 65 00 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"622.5 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"2.64  cu km/yr (25%/14%/61%)","per capita":"305.8  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Environmental Modification, Marine Life Conservation"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"the clearing of land for agricultural purposes and the international demand for tropical timber are contributing to deforestation;
