From the beginning of the privatization process in 1999 through to 2015, around 85% of Montenegrin state-owned companies have been privatized, including 100% of banking, telecommunications, and oil distribution. The government recognizes the need to remove impediments in order to remain competitive and open the economy to foreign investors. The biggest foreign investors in Montenegro are Italy, Norway, Austria, Russia, Hungary and Great Britain. Net foreign direct investment in 2014 reached $483 million and investment per capita is one of the highest in Europe. Montenegro uses the Euro as its domestic currency, though it is not an official member of the Euro-zone. In January 2007, Montenegro joined the World Bank and IMF, and in December 2011, the World Trade Organization. Montenegro began negotiations to join the EC in June, 2012, having met the conditions set down by the European Council, which called on Montenegro to take steps to fight corruption and organized crime. Tourism brings in twice as many visitors as Montenegro’s total population every year. Several new luxury tourism complexes are in various states of development along the coast, and a number are being offered in connection with nearby boating and yachting facilities. Montenegro is currently planning major overhauls of its road, rail networks, and possible expansions of its air transportation system. In 2014, the Government of Montenegro selected two Chinese companies to construct a 41 km-long section of the country’s highway system. Construction will cost around $1.1 billion. Montenegro first instituted value added tax (VAT) in April 2003, and introduced differentiated VAT rates of 17% and 7% (for tourism) in January 2006. In May 2013, the Montenegrin Government raised the higher level VAT rate to 19%."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$3.322 billion (31 December 2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"91"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"8.3%","industry":"21.2%","services":"70.5% (2013 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$1.433 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"151"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Adriatic Sea 0 m","highest point":"Bobotov Kuk 2,522 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"42 30 N, 19 18 E"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"pollution of coastal waters from sewage outlets, especially in tourist-related areas such as Kotor"},"Location":{"value":"Southeastern Europe, between the Adriatic Sea and Serbia"},"Geography - note":{"value":"strategic location along the Adriatic coast"},"Coastline":{"value":"293.5 km"},"Land boundaries":{"total":"680 km","border countries (5)":"Albania 186 km, Bosnia and Herzegovina 242 km, Croatia 19 km, Kosovo 76 km, Serbia 157 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Europe"},"Natural resources":{"value":"bauxite, hydroelectricity"},"Terrain":{"value":"highly indented coastline with narrow coastal plain backed by rugged high limestone mountains and plateaus"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than Connecticut"},"Climate":{"value":"Mediterranean climate, hot dry summers and autumns and relatively cold winters with heavy snowfalls inland"},"Land use":{"agricultural land":"38.2%","value":"arable land 12.9%;

The later medieval state of Zeta maintained its existence until 1496 when Montenegro finally fell under Ottoman rule. Over subsequent centuries, Montenegro managed to maintain a level of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. From the 16th to 19th centuries, Montenegro was a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop princes; in 1852, it transformed into a secular principality. Montenegro was recognized as an independent sovereign principality at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. After World War I, during which Montenegro fought on the side of the Allies, Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929; at the conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When the latter dissolved in 1992, Montenegro federated with Serbia, creating the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, after 2003, shifting to a looser State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. In May 2006, Montenegro invoked its right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to hold a referendum on independence from the state union. The vote for severing ties with Serbia barely exceeded 55% - the threshold set by the EU - allowing Montenegro to formally restore its independence on 3 June 2006."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"PODGORICA (capital) 165,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"15.18% (male 48,138/female 50,095)","15-24 years":"10.27% (male 30,681/female 35,776)","25-54 years":"47.02% (male 164,104/female 140,142)","55-64 years":"13.12% (male 42,354/female 42,542)","65 years and over":"14.41% (male 37,040/female 56,201) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"47.7%","youth dependency ratio":"27.6%","elderly dependency ratio":"20.2%","potential support ratio":"5% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Physicians density":{"value":"2.11 physicians/1,000 population (2013)"},"Languages":{"value":"Serbian 42.9%, Montenegrin (official) 37%, Bosnian 5.3%, Albanian 5.3%, Serbo-Croat 2%, other 3.5%, unspecified 4% (2011 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 4.1% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"39.4% (2005/06)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Religions":{"value":"Orthodox 72.1%, Muslim 19.1%, Catholic 3.4%, atheist 1.2%, other 1.5%, unspecified 2.6% (2011 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"41.1%","male":"42.3%","female":"39.7% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"11"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"6.5% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"65"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"21.4% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"79"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Montenegrin(s)","adjective":"Montenegrin"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Montenegrin 45%, Serbian 28.7%, Bosniak 8.7%, Albanian 4.9%, Muslim 3.3%, Roma 1%, Croat 1%, other 2.6%, unspecified 4.9% (2011 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"4 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.06 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"0.96 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.86 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.17 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.66 male(s)/female","total population":"0.99 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"39.7 years","male":"38.7 years","female":"40.9 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"647,073 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"168"},"Birth rate":{"value":"10.42 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"188"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"NA"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"1% (2013)","country comparison to the world":"133"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"8,520","percentage":"10% (2005 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"15 years","male":"15 years","female":"15 years (2010)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"98.7%","male":"99.5%","female":"98% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Death rate":{"value":"9.43 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"57"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"64% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.34% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"-0.42% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"221"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"intermediate","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial diarrhea","vectorborne disease":"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (2013)"}}}
