Two notable characteristics of the post-war economy were the close interlocking structures of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors, known as keiretsu, and the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor force. Both features are now eroding under the dual pressures of global competition and domestic demographic change.  Scarce in many natural resources, Japan has long been dependent on imported raw materials.  Since the complete shutdown of Japan’s nuclear reactors after the earthquake and tsunami disaster in 2011, Japan's industrial sector has become even more dependent than it was previously on imported fossil fuels. A small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest in the world. While self-sufficient in rice production, Japan imports about 60% of its food on a caloric basis. For three decades, overall real economic growth had been impressive - a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s, averaging just 1.7%, largely because of the aftereffects of inefficient investment and an asset price bubble in the late 1980s that required a protracted period of time for firms to reduce excess debt, capital, and labor. Modest economic growth continued after 2000, but the economy has fallen into recession four times since 2008. Government stimulus spending helped the economy recover in late 2009 and 2010, but the economy contracted again in 2011 as the massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake and the ensuing tsunami in March of that year disrupted manufacturing. The economy has largely recovered in the four years since the disaster, although reconstruction in the affected Tohoku region has lagged, in part due to a shortage of labor in the construction sector. Japan enjoyed a sharp uptick in growth in 2013 on the basis of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s “Three Arrows” economic revitalization agenda - dubbed “Abenomics” - of monetary easing, “flexible” fiscal policy, and structural reform.  Abe’s government has replaced the preceding administration’s plan to phase out nuclear power with a new policy of seeking to restart nuclear power plants that meet strict new safety standards, and emphasizing nuclear energy’s importance as a base-load electricity source.  Japan joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations in 2013, a pact that would open Japan's economy to increased foreign competition and create new export opportunities for Japanese businesses. Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, Japan in 2014 stood as the fourth-largest economy in the world after first-place China, which surpassed Japan in 2001, and third-place India, which edged out Japan in 2012. While seeking to stimulate and reform the economy, the government must also devise a strategy for reining in Japan's huge government debt, which amounts to more than 230% of GDP. To help raise government revenue, Japan adopted legislation in 2012 to gradually raise the consumption tax rate to 10% by 2015, beginning with a hike from 5% to 8% implemented in April 2014.  That increase had a contractionary effect on GDP, however, so PM Abe in late 2014 decided to postpone the final phase of the increase until April 2017 to give the economy more time to recover. Led by the Bank of Japan’s aggressive monetary easing, Japan is making progress in ending deflation, but demographics - low birthrate and an aging, shrinking population - pose major long-term challenges for the economy."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$3.715 trillion (31 December 2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"4"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum 16.1%;

For more than two centuries this policy enabled Japan to enjoy a flowering of its indigenous culture. Japan opened its ports after signing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854 and began to intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power that was able to defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea, Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island. In 1931-32 Japan occupied Manchuria, and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion of China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering America's entry into World War II - and soon occupied much of East and Southeast Asia. After its defeat in World War II, Japan recovered to become an economic power and an ally of the US. While the emperor retains his throne as a symbol of national unity, elected politicians hold actual decision-making power. Following three decades of unprecedented growth, Japan's economy experienced a major slowdown starting in the 1990s, but the country remains an economic power. In March 2011, Japan's strongest-ever earthquake, and an accompanying tsunami, devastated the northeast part of Honshu island, killed thousands, and damaged several nuclear power plants. The catastrophe hobbled the country's economy and its energy infrastructure, and tested its ability to deal with humanitarian disasters. Prime Minister Shinzo ABE was reelected to office in December 2012, and has since embarked on ambitious economic and security reforms to improve Japan's economy and bolster the country's international standing."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"TOKYO (capital) 38.001 million; Osaka-Kobe 20.238 million; Nagoya 9.406 million; Kitakyushu-Fukuoka 5.51 million; Shizuoka-Hamamatsu 3.369 million; Sapporo 2.571 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"13.11% (male 8,582,648/female 8,051,706)","15-24 years":"9.68% (male 6,436,948/female 5,846,808)","25-54 years":"37.87% (male 23,764,421/female 24,297,773)","55-64 years":"12.76% (male 8,104,835/female 8,084,317)","65 years and over":"26.59% (male 14,693,811/female 19,056,392) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"64.5%","youth dependency ratio":"21.1%","elderly dependency ratio":"43.3%","potential support ratio":"2.3% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Physicians density":{"value":"2.3 physicians/1,000 population (2010)"},"Languages":{"value":"Japanese"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"54.3%","note":"percent of women aged 20-49 (2005)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"93"},"Religions":{"value":"Shintoism 79.2%, Buddhism 66.8%, Christianity 1.5%, other 7.1%","note":"total adherents exceeds 100% because many people practice both Shintoism and Buddhism (2012 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"7.9%","male":"8.7%","female":"7.1% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"114"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"10.3% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"22"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"3.5% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"157"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Japanese (singular and plural)","adjective":"Japanese"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Japanese 98.5%, Koreans 0.5%, Chinese 0.4%, other 0.6%","note":"up to 230,000 Brazilians of Japanese origin migrated to Japan in the 1990s to work in industries; some have returned to Brazil (2004)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"13.7 beds/1,000 population (2009)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.06 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.07 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.1 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.98 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.77 male(s)/female","total population":"0.94 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"46.5 years","male":"45.2 years","female":"47.9 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"126,919,659 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"11"},"Birth rate":{"value":"7.93 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"222"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"3.8% of GDP (2012)","country comparison to the world":"115"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"15 years","male":"15 years","female":"15 years (2012)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.4 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"211"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"84.74 years","male":"81.4 years","female":"88.26 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"2"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"2.08 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"2.31 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"1.84 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"222"},"Death rate":{"value":"9.51 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"54"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"93.5% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.56% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"-0.16% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"212"}}}
