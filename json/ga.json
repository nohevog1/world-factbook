It relies heavily on remittances from workers overseas and tourist receipts. Remittance inflows to The Gambia amount to about 20% of the country’s GDP. The government has invested strongly in the agriculture sector because three-quarters of the population depends on the sector for its livelihood and agriculture provides for about one-fifth of GDP. The agricultural sector has untapped potential - less than half of arable land is cultivated. Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and hides. The Gambia's natural beauty and proximity to Europe has made it one of the larger tourist destinations in West Africa, boosted by government and private sector investments in eco-tourism and upscale facilities. Tourism normally brings in about one-fifth of GDP, but suffered in 2014 from tourists’ fears of Ebolavirus in neighboring West African countries. The Gambia's re-export trade accounts for almost 80% of goods exports and China was its largest trade partner for both exports and imports in 2013. In 2012 the IMF renewed an extended credit facility of $28.3 million for three years. Unemployment and underemployment remain high. Economic progress depends on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on responsible government economic management, and on continued technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors. International donors and lenders continue to be concerned about the quality of fiscal management. The Gambia's debt interest payments are projected to consume about 31% of government revenue in 2015. Relations with international donors have been tarnished by the country’s human rights record on homosexuality and human trafficking, perceptions of graft, and a declaration by the president in 2014 that the country would stop using English as the national language."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"foodstuffs, manufactures, fuel, machinery and transport equipment"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"22.8%","industry":"11.8%","services":"65.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$547.4 million (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"172"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"peanut products, fish, cotton lint, palm kernels"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2%","highest 10%":"36.9% (2003)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation 53 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"13 28 N, 16 34 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"8 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.09  cu km/yr (41%/21%/39%)","per capita":"65.77  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation;
