Grenada has rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes but is now saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process. Public debt-to-GDP is about 110%, leaving the MITCHELL administration limited room to engage in public investments and social spending. MITCHELL in 2013 announced a structural adjustment program that includes a plan to increase tax revenue. Strong performances in construction and manufacturing, together with the development of tourism and higher education - especially in medicine - have contributed to growth in national output; however, economic growth remained stagnant in 2010-14 after a sizable contraction in 2009, because of the global economic slowdown's effects on tourism and remittances.

The French settled Grenada in the 17th century, established sugar estates, and imported large numbers of African slaves. Britain took the island in 1762 and vigorously expanded sugar production. In the 19th century, cacao eventually surpassed sugar as the main export crop; in the 20th century, nutmeg became the leading export. In 1967, Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its internal affairs. Full independence was attained in 1974 making Grenada one of the smallest independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Grenada was seized by a Marxist military council on 19 October 1983. Six days later the island was invaded by US forces and those of six other Caribbean nations, which quickly captured the ringleaders and their hundreds of Cuban advisers. Free elections were reinstituted the following year and have continued since then."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"SAINT GEORGE'S (capital) 38,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"24.35% (male 13,958/female 12,998)","15-24 years":"16.02% (male 8,830/female 8,906)","25-54 years":"40.35% (male 22,891/female 21,771)","55-64 years":"9.65% (male 5,482/female 5,204)","65 years and over":"9.62% (male 4,888/female 5,766) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"50.7%","youth dependency ratio":"39.9%","elderly dependency ratio":"10.8%","potential support ratio":"9.3% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.66 physicians/1,000 population (2006)"},"Languages":{"value":"English (official), French patois"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-3.13 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"182"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 44.6%, Protestant 43.5% (includes Anglican 11.5%, Pentecostal 11.3%, Seventh Day Adventist 10.5%, Baptist 2.9%, Church of God 2.6%, Methodist 1.8%, Evangelical 1.6%, other 1.3%), Jehovah's Witness 1.1%, Rastafarian 1.1%, other 6.2%, none 3.6%"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"6.3% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"97"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 3.4% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"24.6% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"78"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Grenadian(s)","adjective":"Grenadian"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"African descent 89.4%, mixed 8.2%, East Indian 1.6%, other 0.9% (includes indigenous) (2001 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"3.5 beds/1,000 population (2012)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.1 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.07 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.99 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.85 male(s)/female","total population":"1.03 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"30.4 years","male":"30.4 years","female":"30.4 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"110,694 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"191"},"Birth rate":{"value":"16.03 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"120"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"16 years","male":"15 years","female":"16 years (2009)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.06 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"112"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"74.05 years","male":"71.47 years","female":"76.88 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"125"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"10.21 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"9.59 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"10.9 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"136"},"Death rate":{"value":"8.08 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"96"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"35.6% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.33% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.48% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"161"}}}
