Other economic challenges for the government include chronic high rates of poverty, unemployment, inflation, and a large budget deficit and resulting government debt. King ABDALLAH, during the first decade of the 2000s, implemented significant economic reforms, such as opening up foreign trade and privatizing state-owned companies that attracted foreign investment and contributed to average annual economic growth of 8% for 2004 through 2008. The global economic slowdown and regional turmoil since, however, reduced the average annual growth rate to 2.6% for the 2010-2013 period and hurt export-oriented sectors, construction, and tourism. Jordan's finances have been strained by a series of natural gas pipeline attacks in Egypt, causing Jordan to substitute more expensive diesel imports, primarily from Saudi Arabia, to generate electricity. To diversify its energy mix, Jordan is currently exploring nuclear power generation, exploitation of abundant oil shale reserves and renewable technologies, as well as the import of Israeli offshore gas. In August 2012, to correct budgetary and balance of payments imbalances, Jordan entered into a $2.1 billion, three year International Monetary Fund Stand-By Arrangement. In 2014, fiscal reform measures enacted in the previous few years continued to boost government revenues and reduced the budget deficit even as an influx of over 620,000 Syrian refugees since 2011 put additional pressure on expenditures."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$30.86 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"59"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"crude oil, refined petroleum products, machinery, transport equipment, iron, cereals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"3.2%","industry":"29.3%","services":"67.4% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$22.61 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"78"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"clothing, fertilizers, potash, phosphates, vegetables, pharmaceuticals"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.4%","highest 10%":"28.7% (2010 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Dead Sea -408 m","highest point":"Jabal Umm ad Dami 1,854 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"31 00 N, 36 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"0.94 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.94  cu km/yr (31%/4%/65%)","per capita":"166  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"limited natural freshwater resources;

The country's long-time ruler, King HUSSEIN (1953-99), successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. King HUSSEIN in 1988 permanently relinquished Jordanian claims to the West Bank; in 1994 he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King ABDALLAH II, King HUSSEIN's eldest son, assumed the throne following his father's death in 1999. He implemented modest political and economic reforms, but in the wake of the \"Arab Revolution\" across the Middle East, Jordanians continue to press for further political liberalization, government reforms, and economic improvements.
