Denmark is a member of the European Union (EU); Danish legislation and regulations conform to EU standards on almost all issues. Danes enjoy a high standard of living and the Danish economy is characterized by extensive government welfare measures and an equitable distribution of income. Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus, but depends on imports of raw materials for the manufacturing sector. Within the EU, Denmark is among the strongest supporters of trade liberalization. After a long consumption-driven upswing, Denmark's economy began slowing in 2007 with the end of a housing boom. Housing prices dropped markedly in 2008-09 and, following a short respite in 2010, have since continued to decline. Household indebtedness is still relatively high at more than 275% of gross disposable income in the first half of 2013. The global financial crisis has exacerbated this cyclical slowdown through increased borrowing costs and lower export demand, consumer confidence, and investment. Denmark made a modest recovery in 2010, in part because of increased government spending; however, the country experienced a technical recession in late 2010-early 2011 and has been slow to emerge from it in 2012-14 . Historically low levels of unemployment rose sharply with the recession and have remained at about 6% in 2010-13, based on the national measure, about two-thirds average EU unemployment. An impending decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major long-term issue. Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for many years up to 2008, but the budget balance swung into deficit in 2009, where it remains. In spite of the deficits, the new coalition government delivered a modest stimulus to the economy in 2012. Despite previously meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), Denmark has negotiated an opt-out with the EU and is not required to adopt the euro."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$231.7 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"34"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, raw materials and semimanufactures for industry, chemicals, grain and foodstuffs, consumer goods"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"1.3%","industry":"21.2%","services":"77.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$571.4 billion (31 December 2011)","country comparison to the world":"22"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and instruments, meat and meat products, dairy products, fish, pharmaceuticals, furniture, windmills"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"1.9%","highest 10%":"28.7% (2007)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Lammefjord -7 m","highest point":"Mollehoj/Ejer Bavnehoj 171 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"56 00 N, 10 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"6 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.66  cu km/yr (58%/5%/36%)","per capita":"118.4  cu m/yr (2009)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"air pollution, principally from vehicle and power plant emissions;
