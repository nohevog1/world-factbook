The bailout triggered a two-week bank closure and the imposition of capital controls that were completely withdrawn in April 2015. Cyprus' two largest banks merged and the combined entity was recapitalized through conversion of some large bank deposits to shares and imposition of losses on bank bondholders. As with other EU countries, the Troika conditioned the bailout on passing financial and structural reforms and privatizing state-owned enterprises. Despite downsizing and restructuring, the Cypriot financial sector throughout 2014 remained burdened by the largest stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the euro-zone, equal to nearly half of all loans. Since the bailout, Cyprus has received positive appraisals by the Troika but met its first signs of resistance to passing bailout-mandated legislation in 2014. Political disagreements held up passage of contentious legislation required by the Troika to reform bankruptcy rules, delaying disbursal of bailout funds during the second half of the year. In October 2013, a US-Israeli consortium completed preliminary appraisals of hydrocarbon deposits in Cyprus’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which revealed an estimated gross mean reserve of about 140 billion cubic meters. Though exploration continues in Cyprus’ EEZ, no additional commercially exploitable reserves were identified during the exploratory drilling in 2014/2015. Nevertheless, developing its offshore hydrocarbon resources remains a critical component to the government’s economic recovery efforts. Industry experts say there may be exploratory and development drilling in 2016 and 2017.","Economy - overview":"Even though the whole of the island is part of the EU, implementation of the EU \"acquis communautaire\" has been suspended in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots, known locally as the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" (\"TRNC\"), until political conditions permit the reunification of the island.

Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to overthrow the elected president of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot administered area declared itself the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" (\"TRNC\"), but it is recognized only by Turkey. In February 2014, after a hiatus of nearly two years, the leaders of the two communities resumed formal discussions under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island. Talks were suspended in October 2014, but the UN has continued discussions with both sides in an effort to resume talks. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the internationally recognized government, and is suspended in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots. However, individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of European Union states."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"NICOSIA (capital) 251,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"15.61% (male 95,431/female 90,159)","15-24 years":"14.87% (male 96,152/female 80,633)","25-54 years":"46.97% (male 293,582/female 264,935)","55-64 years":"11.05% (male 62,826/female 68,551)","65 years and over":"11.51% (male 59,363/female 77,565) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"41.6%","youth dependency ratio":"23.4%","elderly dependency ratio":"18.2%","potential support ratio":"5.5% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"fewer than 100 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"124"},"Physicians density":{"value":"2.33 physicians/1,000 population (2012)"},"Languages":{"value":"Greek (official) 80.9%, Turkish (official) 0.2%, English 4.1%, Romanian 2.9%, Russian 2.5%, Bulgarian 2.2%, Arabic 1.2%, Filippino 1.1%, other 4.3%, unspecified 0.6%","note":"data represents only the government-controlled area of Cyprus (2011 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"400 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"125"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"9.48 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"11"},"Religions":{"value":"Orthodox Christian 89.1%, Roman Catholic 2.9%, Protestant/Anglican 2%, Muslim 1.8%, Buddhist 1%, other (includes Maronite, Armenian Church, Hindu) 1.4%, unknown 1.1%, none/atheist 0.6%","note":"data represents only the government-controlled area of Cyprus (2011 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"27.8%","male":"28.8%","female":"26.6% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"32"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"7.4% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"72"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"24.5% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"53"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Cypriot(s)","adjective":"Cypriot"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Greek 98.8%, other 1% (includes Maronite, Armenian, Turkish-Cypriot), unspecified 0.2%","note":"data represents only the government-controlled area of Cyprus (2011 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"3.5 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.06 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.19 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.11 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.92 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.77 male(s)/female","total population":"1.04 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"36.1 years","male":"34.7 years","female":"37.7 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"1,189,197 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"161"},"Birth rate":{"value":"11.41 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"172"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"7.2% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"19"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"14 years","male":"14 years","female":"14 years (2012)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"99.1%","male":"99.5%","female":"98.7% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.46 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"202"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.06% (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"117"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"78.51 years","male":"75.7 years","female":"81.46 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"54"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"8.36 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"9.97 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"6.68 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"152"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.62 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"143"},"People - note":{"value":"demographic data for Cyprus include the population in the government-controlled area and the area administered by Turkish Cypriots"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"66.9% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.89% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.43% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"84"}}}
