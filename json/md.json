With a moderate climate and good farmland, Moldova's economy relies heavily on its agriculture sector, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova also depends on annual remittances of about $1.6 billion from the roughly one million Moldovans working in Europe, Russia, and other former Soviet Bloc countries. With few natural energy resources, Moldova imports almost all of its energy supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Moldova's dependence on Russian energy is underscored by a growing $5 billion debt to Russian natural gas supplier Gazprom, largely the result of unreimbursed natural gas consumption in the separatist Transnistria region. In August 2013, work began on a new pipeline between Moldova and Romania that may eventually break Russia's monopoly on Moldova's gas supplies. The government's goal of EU integration has resulted in some market-oriented progress. Moldova experienced better than expected economic growth in 2014 due to increased agriculture production, to economic policies adopted by the Moldovan government since 2009, and to the receipt of EU trade preferences. Moldova signed an Association Agreement and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU during fall 2014, connecting Moldovan products to the world’s largest market. Still, growth has been hampered by high prices for Russian natural gas, a Russian import ban on Moldovan wine, increased foreign scrutiny of Moldovan agricultural products, and by Moldova’s large external debt. Over the longer term, Moldova's economy remains vulnerable to political uncertainty, weak administrative capacity, vested bureaucratic interests, corruption, higher fuel prices, Russian pressure, and the illegal separatist regime in Moldova's Transnistria region."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$20.71 million (31 December 2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"120"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"mineral products and fuel, machinery and equipment, chemicals, textiles"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"15.7%","industry":"20%","services":"64.3% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$6.501 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"120"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"foodstuffs, textiles, machinery"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.3%","highest 10%":"26% (2010 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Dniester (Nistru) 2 m","highest point":"Dealul Balanesti 430 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"47 00 N, 29 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"11.65 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"1.07  cu km/yr (14%/83%/4%)","per capita":"290  cu m/yr (2010)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"heavy use of agricultural chemicals, including banned pesticides such as DDT, has contaminated soil and groundwater;

Although the country has been independent from the USSR since 1991, Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the Nistru River supporting the separatist region of Transnistria, composed of a Slavic majority population (mostly Ukrainians and Russians), but with a sizable ethnic Moldovan minority. Europe's poorest economy, Moldova became the first former Soviet state to elect a communist, Vladimir VORONIN, as its president in 2001. VORONIN served as Moldova's president until he resigned in September 2009. Four Moldovan opposition parties then formed a new coalition, the Alliance for European Integration (AEI), iterations of which acted as Moldova's governing coalitions over the next several years. In May 2013, two of the original AEI parties and a splinter group from a third re-formed a ruling coalition called the Pro-European Coalition. The Moldovan Government in summer 2014 signed and ratified an Association Agreement with the EU, advancing the Coalition's policy priority of EU integration. Following the country's most recent legislative election in November 2014, the three pro-European parties that entered Parliament won a total of 55 of the body's 101 seats, enough for a majority coalition. After negotiations among the three broke down, however, two of the parties - the Liberal Democratic Party (PLDM) and the Democratic Party (PD) - agreed to form the Alliance for a European Moldova (AEM) and a minority government with their combined 42 seats. In February 2015, the PLDM and the PD secured Communist Party of the Republic of Moldova support to win parliamentary approval with 60 votes for their minority government."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"CHISINAU (capital) 725,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"17.86% (male 326,681/female 306,763)","15-24 years":"13.49% (male 247,183/female 231,389)","25-54 years":"43.73% (male 777,648/female 773,401)","55-64 years":"13.24% (male 214,846/female 254,818)","65 years and over":"11.68% (male 159,145/female 254,973) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"34.6%","youth dependency ratio":"21.2%","elderly dependency ratio":"13.4%","potential support ratio":"7.5% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"800 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"72"},"Physicians density":{"value":"2.98 physicians/1,000 population (2013)"},"Languages":{"value":"Moldovan 58.8% (official; virtually the same as the Romanian language), Romanian 16.4%, Russian 16%, Ukrainian 3.8%, Gagauz 3.1% (a Turkish language), Bulgarian 1.1%, other 0.3%, unspecified 0.4%","note":"percentages represent lanugage usually spoken (2004 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 23.6% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"67.8% (2005)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"17,600 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"81"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-9.67 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"214"},"Religions":{"value":"Orthodox 93.3%, Baptist 1%, other Christian 1.2%, other 0.9%, atheist 0.4%, none 1%, unspecified 2.2% (2004 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"13.1%","male":"12.8%","female":"13.4% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"87"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"11.8% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"8"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 11.6% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"15.7% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"91"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Moldovan(s)","adjective":"Moldovan"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Moldovan 75.8%, Ukrainian 8.4%, Russian 5.9%, Gagauz 4.4%, Romanian 2.2%, Bulgarian 1.9%, other 1%, unspecified 0.4%","note":"internal disputes with ethnic Slavs in the Transnistrian region (2004 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"6.2 beds/1,000 population (2012)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.06 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.07 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.07 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.84 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.62 male(s)/female","total population":"0.95 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"36 years","male":"34.2 years","female":"38 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"3,546,847 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"133"},"Birth rate":{"value":"12 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"165"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"8.3% of GDP (2012)","country comparison to the world":"10"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"2.2% (2012)","country comparison to the world":"111"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"72,364","percentage":"16% (2009 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"12 years","male":"12 years","female":"12 years (2013)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"99.4%","male":"99.7%","female":"99.1% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.56 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"187"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.63% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"60"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"70.42 years","male":"66.55 years","female":"74.54 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"154"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"12.59 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"14.44 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"10.62 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"120"},"Death rate":{"value":"12.59 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"22"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"45% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"-0.73% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"-1.03% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"229"}}}
