Mauritius has achieved steady growth over the last several decades, resulting in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than 32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Mauritiusâ€™ textile sector has taken advantage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, with Mauritian exports to the US growing by 400% from 2001-2012. Mauritius' sound economic policies and prudent banking practices helped to mitigate negative effects of the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew in the 3-4% per year range in 2010-14, and the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach around the globe."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$7.442 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"81"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"manufactured goods, capital equipment, foodstuffs, petroleum products, chemicals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"4.5%","industry":"22.4%","services":"73.2% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$5.229 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"122"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"clothing and textiles, sugar, cut flowers, molasses, fish, primates (for research)"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mont Piton 828 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"20 17 S, 57 33 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"2.75 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.73  cu km/yr (30%/3%/68%)","per capita":"568.2  cu m/yr (2003)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"water pollution, degradation of coral reefs"},"Location":{"value":"Southern Africa, island in the Indian Ocean, about 800 km (500 mi) east of Madagascar"},"Geography - note":{"value":"the main island, from which the country derives its name, is of volcanic origin and is almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs;

The French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has one of Africa's highest per capita incomes."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"PORT LOUIS (capital) 135,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"20.74% (male 141,928/female 135,918)","15-24 years":"15.3% (male 103,549/female 101,469)","25-54 years":"44% (male 294,700/female 294,863)","55-64 years":"11.15% (male 70,810/female 78,599)","65 years and over":"8.81% (male 47,900/female 70,091) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"40.6%","youth dependency ratio":"27.2%","elderly dependency ratio":"13.4%","potential support ratio":"7.4% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"500 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"88"},"Physicians density":{"value":"1.62 physicians/1,000 population (2013)"},"Languages":{"value":"Creole 86.5%, Bhojpuri 5.3%, French 4.1%, two languages 1.4%, other 2.6% (includes English, the official language, which is spoken by less than 1% of the population), unspecified 0.1% (2011 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 6.9% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"8,300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"101"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"88"},"Religions":{"value":"Hindu 48.5%, Roman Catholic 26.3%, Muslim 17.3%, other Christian 6.4%, other 0.6%, none 0.7%, unspecified 0.1% (2011 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"23.7%","male":"20.4%","female":"28.4% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"41"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"4.8% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"145"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0.1% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"18.8% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"105"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Mauritian(s)","adjective":"Mauritian"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Indo-Mauritian 68%, Creole 27%, Sino-Mauritian 3%, Franco-Mauritian 2%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"3.4 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.02 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.9 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.68 male(s)/female","total population":"0.97 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"34.4 years","male":"33.5 years","female":"35.3 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"1,339,827 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"157"},"Birth rate":{"value":"13.29 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"151"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"3.7% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"123"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"16 years","male":"15 years","female":"16 years (2012)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"90.6%","male":"92.9%","female":"88.5% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.76 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"160"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.92% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"49"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"75.4 years","male":"71.94 years","female":"79.03 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"100"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"10.3 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"12.24 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"8.26 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"135"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.91 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"135"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"39.7% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"-0.08% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.64% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"150"}}}
