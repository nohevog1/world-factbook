It enjoys a remarkably open and corruption-free environment, stable prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most developed countries. Unemployment is very low. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly of consumer electronics, information technology products, medical and optical devices, pharmaceuticals, and on its vibrant transportation, business, and financial services sectors. The economy contracted 0.6% in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis, but has continued to grow since 2010 on the strength of renewed exports. Growth in 2014 was slower at 2.9%, largely a result of soft demand for exports amid a sluggish global economy and weak growth in Singapore’s manufacturing sector. The government is attempting to restructure Singapore’s economy by weaning its dependence on foreign labor, addressing weak productivity, and increasing Singaporean wages. Singapore has attracted major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology production and will continue efforts to strengthen its position as Southeast Asia's leading financial and high-tech hub. Singapore is a member of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade negotiations, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiations with the nine other ASEAN members plus Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, and in 2015, Singapore will form, with the other ASEAN members, the ASEAN Economic Community."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$747.8 billion (31 December 2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"19"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, mineral fuels, chemicals, foodstuffs, consumer goods"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"0%","industry":"25%","services":"75% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$0 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"75"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment (including electronics and telecommunications), pharmaceuticals and other chemicals, refined petroleum products, foodstuffs and beverages"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.3%","highest 10%":"11% (2014)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Singapore Strait 0 m","highest point":"Bukit Timah 166 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"1 22 N, 103 48 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"0.6 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.19  cu km/yr (47%/53%/0%)","per capita":"81.97  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"industrial pollution;
