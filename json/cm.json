Cameroon’s economy suffers from political and economic factors that often impact underdeveloped countries, such as stagnant per capita income, a relatively inequitable distribution of income, a top-heavy civil service, endemic corruption, the continuing inefficiencies of a large parastatal system in key sectors, and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. The IMF continues to press for economic reforms, including increased budget transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs.  The Government of Cameroon provides subsidies for electricity, food, and fuel that have strained the federal budget diverting funds from education, healthcare, and infrastructure projects. Cameroon devotes significant resources to several large infrastructure projects under construction, including a deep sea port in Kribi and the Lom Pangar Hydropower Project. Cameroon’s energy sector continues to diversify, recently opening a natural gas powered electricity generating plant. Oil remains Cameroon’s main export commodity accounting for nearly 40% of export earnings despite falling global oil prices. Cameroon continues to seek foreign investment to improve its inadequate infrastructure, create jobs and improve its economic footprint but its unfavorable business environment remains a significant deterrent to foreign investment."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$230 million (31 December 2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"116"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery, electrical equipment, transport equipment, fuel, food"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"19.9%","industry":"27.6%","services":"52.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$4.217 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"126"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"crude oil and petroleum products, lumber, cocoa beans, aluminum, coffee, cotton"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.3%","highest 10%":"35.4% (2001)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Fako 4,095 m (on Cameroon Mountain)"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"6 00 N, 12 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"285.5 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.97  cu km/yr (23%/10%/68%)","per capita":"58.9  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"waterborne diseases are prevalent; deforestation; overgrazing; desertification; poaching; overfishing"},"Location":{"value":"Central Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria"},"Geography - note":{"value":"sometimes referred to as the hinge of Africa; throughout the country there are areas of thermal springs and indications of current or prior volcanic activity; Mount Cameroon, the highest mountain in Sub-Saharan west Africa, is an active volcano"},"Coastline":{"value":"402 km"},"Land boundaries":{"total":"5,018 km","border countries (6)":"Central African Republic 901 km, Chad 1,116 km, Republic of the Congo 494 km, Equatorial Guinea 183 km, Gabon 349 km, Nigeria 1,975 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Africa"},"Natural resources":{"value":"petroleum, bauxite, iron ore, timber, hydropower"},"Terrain":{"value":"diverse, with coastal plain in southwest, dissected plateau in center, mountains in west, plains in north"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"slightly larger than California"},"Climate":{"value":"varies with terrain, from tropical along coast to semiarid and hot in north"},"Land use":{"agricultural land":"20.6%","value":"arable land 13.1%; permanent crops 3.3%; permanent pasture 4.2%","forest":"41.7%","other":"37.7% (2011 est.)"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":"12 nm","contiguous zone":"24 nm"},"Irrigated land":{"value":"256.5 sq km (2003)"},"Natural hazards":{"value":"volcanic activity with periodic releases of poisonous gases from Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun volcanoes","volcanism":"Mt.
