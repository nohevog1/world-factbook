After three decades of one-party rule under President Hastings Kamuzu BANDA, the country held multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections in 1994, under a provisional constitution that came into full effect the following year. President Bingu wa MUTHARIKA, elected in May 2004 after a failed attempt by the previous president to amend the constitution to permit another term, struggled to assert his authority against his predecessor and subsequently started his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party in 2005. MUTHARIKA was reelected to a second term in May 2009. He oversaw some economic improvement in his first term, but was accused of economic mismanagement and poor governance in his second term. He died abruptly in April 2012 and was succeeded by vice president, Joyce BANDA, who had earlier started her own party, the People's Party. MUTHARIKA's brother, Peter MUTHARIKA, defeated BANDA in the May 2014 election. Population growth, increasing pressure on agricultural lands, corruption, and the scourge of HIV/AIDS pose major problems for Malawi."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"LILONGWE (capital) 905,000; Blantyre-Limbe 808,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"46.73% (male 4,175,706/female 4,218,955)","15-24 years":"20.38% (male 1,820,047/female 1,841,331)","25-54 years":"27.14% (male 2,418,126/female 2,457,419)","55-64 years":"3.06% (male 262,067/female 287,637)","65 years and over":"2.69% (male 213,735/female 269,674) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"94.5%","youth dependency ratio":"87.9%","elderly dependency ratio":"6.7%","potential support ratio":"14.9% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"32,600 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"11"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.02 physicians/1,000 population (2009)"},"Languages":{"value":"English (official), Chichewa (common), Chinyanja, Chiyao, Chitumbuka, Chilomwe, Chinkhonde, Chingoni, Chisena, Chitonga, Chinyakyusa, Chilambya"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 59% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"46.1% (2010)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"1,063,900 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"10"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"89"},"Religions":{"value":"Christian 82.6%, Muslim 13%, other 1.9%, none 2.5% (2008 est.)"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"8.3% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"35"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 9.8% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"4.3% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"168"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Malawian(s)","adjective":"Malawian"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Chewa 32.6%, Lomwe 17.6%, Yao 13.5%, Ngoni 11.5%, Tumbuka 8.8%, Nyanja 5.8%, Sena 3.6%, Tonga 2.1%, Ngonde 1%, other 3.5%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"1.3 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.02 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"0.99 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.99 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.98 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.91 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.79 male(s)/female","total population":"0.98 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"16.4 years","male":"16.3 years","female":"16.5 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"17,964,697","note":"estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"63"},"Birth rate":{"value":"41.56 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"7"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"5.4% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"60"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"13.8% (2010)","country comparison to the world":"52"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"993,318","percentage":"26% (2006 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"11 years","male":"11 years","female":"11 years (2011)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"65.8%","male":"73%","female":"58.6% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"5.6 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"8"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"10.04% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"9"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"60.66 years","male":"58.67 years","female":"62.69 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"196"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"46.26 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"53.07 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"39.35 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"42"},"Death rate":{"value":"8.41 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"82"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"16.3% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"3.77% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"3.32% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"2"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"malaria and dengue fever","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
