The economy has a small formal sector, focused mainly on the export of those natural resources, and an informal sector, employing the majority of the population. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the people. Mineral deposits, including copper, gold, and oil, account for nearly two-thirds of export earnings. Natural gas reserves amount to an estimated 155 billion cubic meters. A consortium led by a major American oil company is constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production facility that could begin exporting in 2014. As the largest investment project in the country's history, it has the potential to double GDP in the near-term and triple Papua New Guinea's export revenue. An American-owned firm also opened PNG's first oil refinery in 2004 and is building a second LNG production facility. The government faces the challenge of ensuring transparency and accountability for revenues flowing from this and other large LNG projects. In 2011 and 2012, the National Parliament passed legislation that created an offshore Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) to manage government surpluses from mineral, oil, and natural gas projects. In recent years, the government has opened up markets in telecommunications and air transport, making both more affordable to the people. Numerous challenges still face the government of Peter O'NEILL, including providing physical security for foreign investors, regaining investor confidence, restoring integrity to state institutions, promoting economic efficiency by privatizing moribund state institutions, and maintaining good relations with Australia, its former colonial ruler. Other socio-cultural challenges could upend the economy including chronic law and order and land tenure issues. The global financial crisis had little impact because of continued foreign demand for PNG's commodities."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$9.742 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"74"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, food, fuels, chemicals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"26.3%","industry":"39%","services":"34.8% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$28.07 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"73"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"oil, gold, copper ore, logs, palm oil, coffee, cocoa, crayfish, prawns"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"1.7%","highest 10%":"40.5% (1996)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mount Wilhelm 4,509 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"6 00 S, 147 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"801 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.39  cu km/yr (57%/43%/0%)","per capita":"61.3  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"rain forest subject to deforestation as a result of growing commercial demand for tropical timber;
