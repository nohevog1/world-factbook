In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the sixth-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in oil reserves. Strong revenues from hydrocarbon exports have brought Algeria relative macroeconomic stability, with foreign currency reserves approaching $200 billion and a large budget stabilization fund available for tapping. In addition, Algeria's external debt is extremely low at about 2% of GDP. However, Algeria has struggled to develop non-hydrocarbon industries because of heavy regulation and an emphasis on state-driven growth. The government's efforts have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages. A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian Government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases, moves which continue to weigh on public finances. Long-term economic challenges include diversifying the economy away from its reliance on hydrocarbon exports, bolstering the private sector, attracting foreign investment, and providing adequate jobs for younger Algerians."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"capital goods, foodstuffs, consumer goods"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"8.6%","industry":"48.3%","services":"43.1% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$5.285 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"129"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products 97% (2009 est.)"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.8%","highest 10%":"26.8% (1995)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Chott Melrhir -40 m","highest point":"Tahat 3,003 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"28 00 N, 3 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"11.67 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"5.72  cu km/yr (26%/16%/58%)","per capita":"182  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"soil erosion from overgrazing and other poor farming practices;
