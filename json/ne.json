Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of emigration to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and financial services, although the International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination of all offshore banking licenses. Economic aid allocation from New Zealand in FY13/14 was US$10.1 million. While in the process of rebuilding, Niue has been dependent on foreign aid."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"food, live animals, manufactured goods, machinery, fuels, lubricants, chemicals, drugs"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"23.5%","industry":"26.9%","services":"49.5% (2003)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$418,000 (2002 est.)","country comparison to the world":"201"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"canned coconut cream, copra, honey, vanilla, passion fruit products, pawpaws, root crops, limes, footballs, stamps, handicrafts"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation near Mutalau settlement 68 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"19 02 S, 169 52 W"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"increasing attention to conservationist practices to counter loss of soil fertility from traditional slash and burn agriculture"},"Location":{"value":"Oceania, island in the South Pacific Ocean, east of Tonga"},"Geography - note":{"value":"one of world's largest coral islands"},"Coastline":{"value":"64 km"},"Land boundaries":{"value":"0 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Oceania"},"Natural resources":{"value":"fish, arable land"},"Terrain":{"value":"steep limestone cliffs along coast, central plateau"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"1.5 times the size of Washington, DC"},"Climate":{"value":"tropical; modified by southeast trade winds"},"Land use":{"agricultural land":"19.1%","value":"arable land 3.8%; permanent crops 11.5%; permanent pasture 3.8%","forest":"71.2%","other":"9.7% (2011 est.)"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":"12 nm","exclusive economic zone":"200 nm"},"Irrigated land":{"value":"NA"},"Natural hazards":{"value":"typhoons"},"Area":{"total":"260 sq km","land":"260 sq km","water":"0 sq km","country comparison to the world":"213"}},"Transportation":{"Airports":{"value":"1 (2013)","country comparison to the world":"228"},"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":"1","1,524 to 2,437 m":"1 (2012)"},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":"1","1,524 to 2,437 m":"1 (2013)"},"Roadways":{"total":"120 km","paved":"120 km (2011)","country comparison to the world":"214"},"Ports and terminals":{"major seaport(s)":"Alofi"}},"Military":{"Military branches":{"value":"no regular indigenous military forces; Police Force"},"Military - note":{"value":"defense is the responsibility of New Zealand"}},"Transnational Issues":{"Disputes - international":{"value":"none"}},"Government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Niue","note":"pronunciation falls between nyu-way and new-way, but not like new-wee","former":"Savage Island"},"Government type":{"value":"self-governing parliamentary democracy"},"Diplomatic representation in the US":{"value":"none (self-governing territory in free association with New Zealand)"},"Political parties and leaders":{"value":"Niue People's Action Party or NPP [Young VIVIAN]"},"Political pressure groups and leaders":{"value":"NA"},"Dependency status":{"value":"self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1974; Niue fully responsible for internal affairs; New Zealand retains responsibility for external affairs and defense; however, these responsibilities confer no rights of control and are only exercised at the request of the Government of Niue"},"Administrative divisions":{"value":"none; note - there are no first-order administrative divisions as defined by the US Government, but there are 14 villages at the second order"},"Diplomatic representation from the US":{"value":"none (self-governing territory in free association with New Zealand)"},"Legal system":{"value":"English common law"},"Legislative branch":{"description":"unicameral Assembly or Fono Ekepule (20 seats; 14 members directly elected in single-seat constituencies by simple majority vote and 6 directly elected from the National Register or \"common roll\" by majority vote; members serve 3-year terms)","elections":"last held on 12 April 2014 (next to be held in 2017)","election results":"percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - 20 independents"},"Constitution":{"value":"several previous (New Zealand colonial statutes); latest 19 October 1974 (Niue Constitution Act 1974); amended 1992, 2007 (2007)"},"Suffrage":{"value":"18 years of age; universal"},"National anthem":{"name":"\"Ko e Iki he Lagi\" (The Lord in Heaven)","lyrics/music":"unknown/unknown, prepared by Sioeli FUSIKATA","note":"adopted 1974"},"Executive branch":{"chief of state":"Queen ELIZABETH II (since 6 February 1952); represented by Governor General of New Zealand Lt.
