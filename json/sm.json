The manufacturing and financial sectors account for more than half of San Marino's GDP. The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy. The economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings. The income tax rate is also very low, about one-third the average EU level. San Marino does not issue public debt securities; when necessary, it finances deficits by drawing down central bank deposits. San Marino's economy has been contracting since 2008, largely due to weakened demand from Italy - which accounts for nearly 90% of its export market - and financial sector consolidation. Difficulties in the banking sector, the recent global economic downturn, and the sizable decline in tax revenues have contributed to negative real GDP growth. The government has adopted measures to counter the economic downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses and is seeking to shift its growth model away from a reliance on bank and tax secrecy. San Marino continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU and international standards. In September 2009, the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully adopt global tax standards, and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries. In 2013 San Marino's Government signed a Double Taxation Agreement with Italy, but a referendum on EU membership failed to reach the quorum needed to bring it to a vote."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"wide variety of consumer manufactures, food, energy"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"0.1%","industry":"39.2%","services":"60.7% (2009)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$NA"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"building stone, lime, wood, chestnuts, wheat, wine, baked goods, hides, ceramics"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Torrente Ausa 55 m","highest point":"Monte Titano 755 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"43 46 N, 12 25 E"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"Air Pollution"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"air pollution; urbanization decreasing rural farmlands"},"Location":{"value":"Southern Europe, an enclave in central Italy"},"Geography - note":{"value":"landlocked; smallest independent state in Europe after the Holy See and Monaco; dominated by the Apennine Mountains"},"Coastline":{"value":"0 km (landlocked)"},"Land boundaries":{"total":"37 km","border countries (1)":"Italy 37 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Europe"},"Natural resources":{"value":"building stone"},"Terrain":{"value":"rugged mountains"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"about one-third the size of Washington, DC"},"Climate":{"value":"Mediterranean; mild to cool winters; warm, sunny summers"},"Land use":{"agricultural land":"16.7%","value":"arable land 16.7%; permanent crops 0%; permanent pasture 0%","forest":"0%","other":"83.3% (2011 est.)"},"Maritime claims":{"value":"none (landlocked)"},"Irrigated land":{"value":"NA"},"Natural hazards":{"value":"NA"},"Area":{"total":"61 sq km","land":"61 sq km","water":"0 sq km","country comparison to the world":"229"}},"Transportation":{"Roadways":{"total":"292 km","paved":"292 km (2006)","country comparison to the world":"206"}},"Military":{"Military branches":{"value":"no regular military forces; voluntary Military Corps (Corpi Militari) performs ceremonial duties and limited police support functions (2010)"},"Military service age and obligation":{"value":"18 is the legal minimum age for voluntary military service; no conscription; government has the authority to call up all San Marino citizens from 16-60 years of age to service in the military (2012)"},"Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":"6,892 (2010 est.)"},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":"5,565","females age 16-49":"6,067 (2010 est.)"},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":"186","female":"166 (2010 est.)"},"Military - note":{"value":"defense is the responsibility of Italy"}},"Transnational Issues":{"Disputes - international":{"value":"none"}},"Government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Republic of San Marino","conventional short form":"San Marino","local long form":"Repubblica di San Marino","local short form":"San Marino"},"Government type":{"value":"republic"},"Diplomatic representation in the US":{"chief of mission":"Ambassador Paolo RONDELLI (since 16 July 2007)","chancery":"1711 N Street NW, 2nd floor, Washington, DC 20036","telephone":"202-250-1535","FAX":"202-223-2748"},"Political parties and leaders":{"value":"San Marino 3.0 [Simone DELLA VALLE]","other":"Civic Movement R.E.T.E.
