Slovenia became the first 2004 European Union entrant to adopt the euro (on 1 January 2007) and has experienced one of the most stable political transitions in Central and Southeastern Europe. In March 2004, Slovenia became the first transition country to graduate from borrower status to donor partner at the World Bank. In 2007, Slovenia was invited to begin the process for joining the OECD; it became a member in 2012. However, long-delayed privatizations, particularly within Slovenia’s largely state-owned and increasingly indebted banking sector, have fueled investor concerns since 2012 that the country would need EU-IMF financial assistance. In 2013, the European Commission granted Slovenia permission to begin recapitalizing ailing lenders and transferring their nonperforming assets into a “bad bank” established to restore bank balance sheets. Export-led growth fueled by demand in larger European markets pushed GDP growth to 2.6% in 2014, while stubbornly-high unemployment fell slightly to 13%. PM CERAR’s government took office in September 2014, pledging to press ahead with commitments to privatize a select group of state-run companies, rationalize public spending, and further stabilize the banking sector."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$6.783 billion (31  December 2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"82"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, chemicals, fuels and lubricants, food"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"2.1%","industry":"28.4%","services":"69.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$52.48 billion (31 December 2012)","country comparison to the world":"63"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, food"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.9%","highest 10%":"19.8% (2011)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Adriatic Sea 0 m","highest point":"Triglav 2,864 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"46 07 N, 14 49 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"31.87 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.94  cu km/yr (18%/82%/0%)","per capita":"462.9  cu m/yr (2009)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"Sava River polluted with domestic and industrial waste;

In 1918, the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state, which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II, Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which though communist, distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war. Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern state.
