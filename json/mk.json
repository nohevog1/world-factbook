Corruption and weak rule of law remain significant problems. Some businesses complain of opaque regulations and unequal enforcement of the law.  Unemployment has remained consistently high at more than 30% since 2008, but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market, estimated to be between 20% and 45% of GDP, which is not captured by official statistics. Macedoniaâ€™s economy is closely linked to Europe as a customer for exports and source of investment, and has suffered as a result of prolonged weakness in the euro zone. Macedonia maintained macroeconomic stability through the global financial crisis by conducting prudent monetary policy, which keeps the domestic currency pegged against the euro, and by limiting fiscal deficits. The government has been loosening fiscal policy, however, and the budget deficit was 4.2% of GDP in both 2013 and 2014. Public debt at the end of 2014 was 45.8%, which although low by regional comparison, is significant for a small economy."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$2.423 billion (31 December 2012)","country comparison to the world":"99"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, automobiles, chemicals, fuels, food products"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"8.8%","industry":"21.3%","services":"69.9% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$7.194 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"114"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco;

Greece's objection to the new state's use of what it considered a Hellenic name and symbols delayed international recognition, which occurred under the provisional designation of \"the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\" In 1995, Greece lifted a 20-month trade embargo and the two countries agreed to normalize relations, but the issue of the name remained unresolved and negotiations for a solution are ongoing. Since 2004, the US and over 130 other nations have recognized Macedonia by its constitutional name, Republic of Macedonia. Ethnic Albanian grievances over perceived political and economic inequities escalated into an insurgency in 2001 that eventually led to the internationally brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement, which ended the fighting and established guidelines for constitutional amendments and the creation of new laws that enhanced the rights of minorities. Although Macedonia became an EU candidate in 2005, the country still faces challenges, including fully implementing the Framework Agreement, resolving the outstanding name dispute with Greece, improving relations with Bulgaria, halting democratic backsliding, bolstering independence of the judiciary and media freedom, and stimulating economic growth and development. Macedonia's membership in NATO was blocked by Greece at the Alliance's Summit of Bucharest in 2008."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"SKOPJE (capital) 503,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"17.48% (male 189,719/female 176,751)","15-24 years":"13.88% (male 150,048/female 140,834)","25-54 years":"43.69% (male 464,811/female 450,914)","55-64 years":"12.21% (male 125,327/female 130,617)","65 years and over":"12.74% (male 114,357/female 152,637) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"41.4%","youth dependency ratio":"24%","elderly dependency ratio":"17.4%","potential support ratio":"5.7% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"fewer than 100 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"106"},"Physicians density":{"value":"2.62 physicians/1,000 population (2009)"},"Languages":{"value":"Macedonian (official) 66.5%, Albanian (official) 25.1%, Turkish 3.5%, Roma 1.9%, Serbian 1.2%, other 1.8% (2002 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 9.1% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"40.2% (2011)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"200 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"126"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-0.48 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"135"},"Religions":{"value":"Macedonian Orthodox 64.8%, Muslim 33.3%, other Christian 0.4%, other and unspecified 1.5% (2002 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"53.9%","male":"55.2%","female":"51.7% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"4"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"6.4% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"79"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0.6% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"20.8% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"92"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Macedonian(s)","adjective":"Macedonian"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Macedonian 64.2%, Albanian 25.2%, Turkish 3.9%, Roma (Gypsy) 2.7%, Serb 1.8%, other 2.2% (2002 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"4.5 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.08 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.07 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.07 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.96 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.75 male(s)/female","total population":"0.99 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"37.2 years","male":"36.1 years","female":"38.3 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"2,096,015 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"146"},"Birth rate":{"value":"11.55 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"170"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"1.3% (2011)","country comparison to the world":"128"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"16,782","percentage":"6% (2005 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"13 years","male":"13 years","female":"14 years (2012)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"97.8%","male":"98.8%","female":"96.8% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.6 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"180"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.01% (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"131"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"76.02 years","male":"73.44 years","female":"78.79 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"90"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"7.7 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"7.96 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"7.42 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"156"},"Death rate":{"value":"9.08 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"67"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"57.1% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.11% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.2% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"184"}}}
