Independence from Spain was declared in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in 1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the 19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region in subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador prompted the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s. After losing free and fair elections in 1990, 1996, and 2001, former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA Saavedra was elected president in 2006 and reelected in 2011. The 2008 municipal elections, 2010 regional elections, 2011 presidential election, 2012 municipal elections, and 2013 regional elections were marred by widespread irregularities. Nicaragua's infrastructure and economy - hard hit by the earlier civil war and by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 - are slowly being rebuilt, but democratic institutions have been weakened under the ORTEGA administration."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"MANAGUA (capital) 956,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"28.57% (male 860,721/female 827,136)","15-24 years":"22.16% (male 657,339/female 651,744)","25-54 years":"38.69% (male 1,081,081/female 1,204,669)","55-64 years":"5.6% (male 153,711/female 177,334)","65 years and over":"4.98% (male 131,965/female 162,181) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"54.1%","youth dependency ratio":"46.3%","elderly dependency ratio":"7.8%","potential support ratio":"12.8% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"91"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.9 physicians/1,000 population (2014)"},"Languages":{"value":"Spanish (official) 95.3%, Miskito 2.2%, Mestizo of the Caribbean coast 2%, other 0.5%","note":"English and indigenous languages found on the Caribbean coast (2005 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 32.1% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"80.4% (2011/12)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"6,600 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"107"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-3 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"181"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 58.5%, Protestant 23.2% (Evangelical 21.6%, Moravian 1.6%), Jehovah's Witnesses 0.9%, other 1.6%, none 15.7% (2005 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"8.6%","male":"8.1%","female":"9.7% (2006 est.)","country comparison to the world":"110"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"8.4% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"55"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 13% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Demographic profile":{"value":"Nicaraguans emigrate primarily to Costa Rica and to a lesser extent the United States.
