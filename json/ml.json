The country's fiscal status fluctuates with gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest; cotton and gold exports make up around 80% of export earnings. Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65% of its land area is desert or semidesert. About 10% of the population is nomadic and about 80% of the labor force is engaged in farming and fishing. Mali remains dependent on foreign aid. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities. Mali is developing its iron ore extraction industry to diversify foreign exchange earnings away from gold, but the pace will largely depend on global price trends. The government is subsidizing the production of cereals to decrease the country’s dependence on imported foodstuffs and to reduce its vulnerability to food price shocks. The main threat to Mali’s economy is a return to physical insecurity. Other long term threats to the economy include high population growth, corruption, a weak infrastructure, and low levels of human capital. The administration’s purchase of a presidential jet for $40 million and inflated defense contracts damaged its credibility and led the IMF to temporarily suspend aid in 2014."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum, machinery and equipment, construction materials, foodstuffs, textiles"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"38%","industry":"23.3%","services":"38.7% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$3.431 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"136"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"cotton, gold, livestock"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.5%","highest 10%":"25.8% (2010 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Senegal River 23 m","highest point":"Hombori Tondo 1,155 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"17 00 N, 4 00 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"100 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"6.55  cu km/yr (9%/1%/90%)","per capita":"545.4  cu m/yr (2000)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation;

When Senegal withdrew after only a few months, what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali. Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a military coup that ushered in a period of democratic rule. President Alpha KONARE won Mali's first two democratic presidential elections in 1992 and 1997. In keeping with Mali's two-term constitutional limit, he stepped down in 2002 and was succeeded by Amadou Toumani TOURE, who was elected to a second term in a 2007 election that was widely judged to be free and fair. Malian returnees from Libya in 2011 exacerbated tensions in northern Mali, and Tuareg ethnic militias rebelled in January 2012. Low- and mid-level soldiers, frustrated with the poor handling of the rebellion, overthrew TOURE on 22 March. Intensive mediation efforts led by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) returned power to a civilian administration in April with the appointment of Interim President Dioncounda TRAORE. The post-coup chaos led to rebels expelling the Malian military from the country's three northern regions and allowed Islamic militants to set up strongholds. Hundreds of thousands of northern Malians fled the violence to southern Mali and neighboring countries, exacerbating regional food shortages in host communities. An international military intervention to retake the three northern regions began in January 2013 and within a month most of the north had been retaken. In a democratic presidential election conducted in July and August of 2013, Ibrahim Boubacar KEITA was elected president."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"BAMAKO (capital) 2.515 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"47.44% (male 4,038,801/female 4,005,256)","15-24 years":"19.09% (male 1,543,751/female 1,693,410)","25-54 years":"26.75% (male 2,106,889/female 2,428,643)","55-64 years":"3.75% (male 317,513/female 317,957)","65 years and over":"2.97% (male 251,693/female 251,623) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"100.2%","youth dependency ratio":"95.1%","elderly dependency ratio":"5%","potential support ratio":"19.8% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"5,300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"29"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.08 physicians/1,000 population (2010)"},"Languages":{"value":"French (official), Bambara 46.3%, Peul/foulfoulbe 9.4%, Dogon 7.2%, Maraka/soninke 6.4%, Malinke 5.6%, Sonrhai/djerma 5.6%, Minianka 4.3%, Tamacheq 3.5%, Senoufo 2.6%, unspecified 0.6%, other 8.5%","note":"Mali has 13 national languages in addition to its official language"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 75.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"10.3% (2012/13)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"133,400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"35"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-2.26 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"172"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 94.8%, Christian 2.4%, Animist 2%, none 0.5%, unspecified 0.3% (2009 Census)"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"7.1% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"119"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 23% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"5.7% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"166"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Malian(s)","adjective":"Malian"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Mande 50% (Bambara, Malinke, Soninke), Peul 17%, Voltaic 12%, Songhai 6%, Tuareg and Moor 10%, other 5%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"0.1 beds/1,000 population (2010)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.91 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.87 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"1 male(s)/female","total population":"0.95 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"16.1 years","male":"15.5 years","female":"16.8 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"16,955,536 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"66"},"Birth rate":{"value":"44.99 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"2"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"4.8% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"83"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"27.9% (2006)","country comparison to the world":"20"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"1,485,027","percentage":"36% (2010 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"8 years","male":"9 years","female":"7 years (2011)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"38.7%","male":"48.2%","female":"29.2% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"6.06 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"3"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"1.42% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"35"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"55.34 years","male":"53.48 years","female":"57.25 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"208"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"102.23 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"108.88 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"95.37 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"2"},"Death rate":{"value":"12.89 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"19"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"39.9% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"5.08% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"2.98% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"8"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"malaria and dengue fever","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","respiratory disease":"meningococcal meningitis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
