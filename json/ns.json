Five years later the civilian government was replaced by a military regime that soon declared a socialist republic. It continued to exert control through a succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In 1990, the military overthrew the civilian leadership, but a democratically elected government - a four-party coalition - returned to power in 1991. The coalition expanded to eight parties in 2005 and ruled until August 2010, when voters returned former military leader Desire BOUTERSE and his opposition coalition to power."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"PARAMARIBO (capital) 234,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"25.66% (male 75,791/female 72,934)","15-24 years":"17.48% (male 51,657/female 49,662)","25-54 years":"44.3% (male 130,726/female 126,048)","55-64 years":"6.81% (male 19,291/female 20,198)","65 years and over":"5.75% (male 14,395/female 18,931) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"50.8%","youth dependency ratio":"40.4%","elderly dependency ratio":"10.4%","potential support ratio":"9.6% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"200 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"100"},"Languages":{"value":"Dutch (official), English (widely spoken), Sranang Tongo (Surinamese, sometimes called Taki-Taki, is native language of Creoles and much of the younger population and is lingua franca among others), Caribbean Hindustani (a dialect of Hindi), Javanese"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 20.8% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"47.6% (2010)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"3,800 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"110"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0.56 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"70"},"Religions":{"value":"Hindu 27.4%, Protestant 25.2% (predominantly Moravian), Roman Catholic 22.8%, Muslim 19.6%, indigenous beliefs 5%"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"21.5% (2004 est.)","country comparison to the world":"51"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 5.2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Demographic profile":{"value":"Some 350,000 people of Surinamese descent live in the Netherlands, Suriname's former colonial ruler.
