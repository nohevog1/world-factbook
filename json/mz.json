Socialist mismanagement and a brutal civil war from 1977-92 exacerbated the situation. In 1987, the government embarked on a series of macroeconomic reforms designed to stabilize the economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance and with political stability since the multi-party elections in 1994, propelled the countryâ€™s GDP from $4 billion in 1993, following the war, to about $30.9 billion in 2014. Fiscal reforms, including the introduction of a value-added tax and reform of the customs service, have improved the government's revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains, more than half the population remains below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture continues to employ the vast majority of the country's work force. A substantial trade imbalance persists although aluminum production from the Mozal smelter has significantly boosted export earnings in recent years. In 2012, The Mozambican government took over Portugal's last remaining share in the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectricity Company (HCB), a significant contributor to the Southern African Power Pool. The government has plans to expand the Cahora Bassa Dam and build additional dams to increase its electricity exports and fulfill the needs of its burgeoning domestic industries. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives, and is now at a manageable level. In July 2007, the US government's Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed a $506.9 million Compact with Mozambique that ended in 2013. The Compact focused on improving sanitation, roads, agriculture, and the business regulation environment in an effort to spur economic growth in the four northern provinces of the country. Citizens rioted in September 2010 after fuel, water, electricity, and bread price increases were announced. In an attempt to lessen the negative impact on the population, the government implemented subsidies, decreased taxes and tariffs, and instituted other fiscal measures. Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 6%-8% in the decade up to 2014, one of Africa's strongest performances. Mozambique's ability to attract large investment projects in natural resources is expected to extend high growth rates in coming years. Revenues from these vast resources, including natural gas, coal, titanium and hydroelectric capacity, could overtake donor assistance within five years."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, vehicles, fuel, chemicals, metal products, foodstuffs, textiles"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"28.9%","industry":"24%","services":"47.1% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$6.416 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"112"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"aluminum, prawns, cashews, cotton, sugar, citrus, timber;

Large-scale emigration, economic dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil war hindered the country's development until the mid-1990s. The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between FRELIMO and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) forces ended the fighting in 1992. In December 2004, Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His elected successor, Armando Emilio GUEBUZA, promised to continue the sound economic policies that have encouraged foreign investment. President GUEBUZA was reelected to a second term in October 2009. However, the elections were flawed by voter fraud, questionable disqualification of candidates, and FRELIMO use of government resources during the campaign."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"MAPUTO (capital) 1.187 million; Matola 937,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"45.13% (male 5,740,743/female 5,677,563)","15-24 years":"21.43% (male 2,657,099/female 2,764,109)","25-54 years":"27.09% (male 3,201,321/female 3,654,012)","55-64 years":"3.44% (male 415,357/female 455,450)","65 years and over":"2.91% (male 338,552/female 398,907) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"94.8%","youth dependency ratio":"88.2%","elderly dependency ratio":"6.5%","potential support ratio":"15.3% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"44,900 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"5"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.04 physicians/1,000 population (2012)"},"Languages":{"value":"Emakhuwa 25.3%, Portuguese (official) 10.7%, Xichangana 10.3%, Cisena 7.5%, Elomwe 7%, Echuwabo 5.1%, other Mozambican languages 30.1%, other 4% (1997 census)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 79.5% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"11.6% (2011)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"1.543 million (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"5"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-1.98 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"166"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 28.4%, Muslim 17.9%, Zionist Christian 15.5%, Protestant 12.2% (includes Pentecostal 10.9% and Anglican 1.3%), other 6.7%, none 18.7%, unspecified 0.7% (2007 est.)"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"6.8% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"99"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 48.9% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"4.5% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"158"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Mozambican(s)","adjective":"Mozambican"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"African 99.66% (Makhuwa, Tsonga, Lomwe, Sena, and others), Europeans 0.06%, Euro-Africans 0.2%, Indians 0.08%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"0.7 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.02 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.96 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.88 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.91 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.85 male(s)/female","total population":"0.95 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"17 years","male":"16.4 years","female":"17.6 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"25,303,113","note":"estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"50"},"Birth rate":{"value":"38.58 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"10"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"5% of GDP (2006)","country comparison to the world":"78"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"15.6% (2011)","country comparison to the world":"44"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"1,369,080","percentage":"22% (2008 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"9 years","male":"10 years","female":"9 years (2013)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"58.8%","male":"73.3%","female":"45.4% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"5.21 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"12"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"10.58% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"8"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"52.94 years","male":"52.18 years","female":"53.72 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"214"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"70.21 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"72.29 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"68.09 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"13"},"Death rate":{"value":"12.1 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"26"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"32.2% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"3.27% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"2.45% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"28"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"malaria and dengue fever","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
