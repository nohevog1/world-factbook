Israeli-imposed border closures, which became more restrictive after HAMAS seized control of the territory in June 2007, have resulted in high unemployment, elevated poverty rates, and a sharp contraction of the private sector that had relied primarily on export markets. Egyptian authorities began a crackdown on Gaza’s extensive tunnel-based smuggling network in 2013, creating fuel, construction material, and consumer goods shortages in the territory. Israel’s military operation in Gaza from July to August 2014 - the latest in a series of periodic conflicts between Israel and Gaza-based Palestinian militants -destroyed one-fifth of the territory’s industrial infrastructure, displaced more than 100,000 people, and left 30% of households without access to potable water. Since the conflict, Israel has allowed limited Gaza exports and relaxed some restrictions on construction material imports to assist reconstruction efforts, but the Palestinian Authority will depend on donor and humanitarian aid to finance the $4billion needed to rebuild."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"food, consumer goods, fuel"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"value":"77.4%","note":"data exclude West Bank (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"see entry for West Bank"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"strawberries, carnations, vegetables, fish (small and irregular shipments, as permitted to transit the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Mediterranean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Abu 'Awdah (Joz Abu 'Awdah) 105 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"31 25 N, 34 20 E"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"desertification; salination of fresh water; sewage treatment; water-borne disease; soil degradation; depletion and contamination of underground water resources"},"Location":{"value":"Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Egypt and Israel"},"Geography - note":{"value":"strategic strip of land along Mideast-North African trade routes has experienced an incredibly turbulent history; the town of Gaza itself has been besieged countless times in its history; there are no Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip; the Gaza Strip settlements were evacuated in 2005 (2014)"},"Coastline":{"value":"40 km"},"Land boundaries":{"total":"72 km","border countries (2)":"Egypt 13 km, Israel 59 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Middle East"},"Natural resources":{"value":"arable land, natural gas"},"Terrain":{"value":"flat to rolling, sand- and dune-covered coastal plain"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"slightly more than twice the size of Washington, DC"},"Climate":{"value":"temperate, mild winters, dry and warm to hot summers"},"Maritime claims":{"value":"see entry for Israel","note":"effective 3 January 2009, the Gaza maritime area is closed to all maritime traffic and is under blockade imposed by Israeli Navy until further notice"},"Irrigated land":{"value":"240 sq km; note - includes West Bank (2003)"},"Natural hazards":{"value":"droughts"},"Area":{"total":"360 sq km","land":"360 sq km","water":"0 sq km","country comparison to the world":"206"}},"Transportation":{"Airports":{"value":"1 (2013)","country comparison to the world":"219"},"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":"1","over 3,047 m":"1 (2013)"},"Heliports":{"value":"1 (2013)"},"Roadways":{"note":"see entry for West Bank"},"Ports and terminals":{"major seaport(s)":"Gaza"}},"Military":{"Military branches":{"value":"Hamas does not have a conventional military in the Gaza Strip, but maintains security forces in addition to its military wing, the 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades; the military wing reports to the external Hamas Political Bureau leadership, which has been in exile in Cairo and Doha since closing its Damascus headquarters in late 2011 (2013)"},"Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":"385,961 (2010 est.)"},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":"335,820","females age 16-49":"319,847 (2010 est.)"},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":"18,805","female":"17,903 (2010 est.)"}},"Transnational Issues":{"Disputes - international":{"value":"the status of the Gaza Strip is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations; Israel removed settlers and military personnel from Gaza Strip in August 2005"},"Refugees and internally displaced persons":{"refugees (country of origin)":"1,258,559 (Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)) (2014)","IDPs":"at least 263,500 (includes persons displaced within the Gaza strip due to the intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since June 2014 and other Palestinian IDPs in the Gaza Strip and West Bank who fled as long ago as 1967, although confirmed cumulative figures do not go back beyond 2006) (2015)"}},"Government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"none","conventional short form":"Gaza Strip","local long form":"none","local short form":"Qita' Ghazzah"}},"Energy":{"Electricity - production":{"value":"51,000 kWh (2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"219"},"Electricity - consumption":{"value":"202,000 kWh (2009)","country comparison to the world":"218"},"Electricity - exports":{"value":"0 kWh (2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"150"},"Electricity - imports":{"value":"193,000 kWh (2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"110"},"Crude oil - proved reserves":{"value":"0 bbl (1 January 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"143"}},"Introduction":{"Background":{"value":"In early 2003, the \"Quartet\" of the US, EU, UN, and Russia, presented a roadmap to a final peace settlement by 2005, calling for two states - Israel and a democratic Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late 2004 and the subsequent election of Mahmud ABBAS (head of the Fatah political party) as the PA president, Israel and the PA agreed to move the peace process forward. Israel in late 2005 unilaterally withdrew all of its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip, but continues to control maritime, airspace, and other access. In early 2006, the Islamic Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won the Palestinian Legislative Council election, but attempts to form a unity government between Fatah and HAMAS failed, and violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters ensued, culminating in HAMAS's violent seizure of all military and governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip in June 2007. Fatah and HAMAS in May 2011 reached an agreement aimed at restoring political unity between Gaza and the West Bank, but struggled to implement it. In April 2014, the two factions signed another agreement and two months later President ABBAS formed an interim government of independent technocrats, none of whom were affiliated with HAMAS. In July 2014, HAMAS and other militant groups launched rockets into Israel that resulted in a 51-day conflict between Israel and militants in Gaza. An open-ended truce declared in late August 2014 continues to hold, despite the absence of a durable negotiated cease-fire and occasional truce violations. The status quo remains with HAMAS in control of the Gaza Strip and the PA governing the West Bank."}},"People and Society":{"Nationality":{"noun":"NA","adjective":"NA"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Palestinian Arab"},"Languages":{"value":"Arabic, Hebrew (spoken by many Palestinians), English (widely understood)"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 98.0 - 99.0% (predominantly Sunni), Christian \nnote: dismantlement of Israeli settlements was completed in September 2005; Gaza has had no Jewish population since then (2012 est.)\nreligious affiliation:\n \n          \nPopulation:\n1,869,055 (July 2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  152\nAge structure:\n0-14 years: 42.75% (male 410,599/female 388,473)\n15-24 years: 20.34% (male 194,798/female 185,295)\n25-54 years: 30.66% (male 293,556/female 279,471)\n55-64 years: 3.59% (male 33,843/female 33,198)\n65 years and over: 2.67% (male 20,667/female 29,155) (2015 est.)\npopulation pyramid:\n \n          \nDependency ratios:\ntotal dependency ratio: 76%\nyouth dependency ratio: 70.8%\nelderly dependency ratio: 5.2%\npotential support ratio: 19.2%\nnote: data represents Gaza and the West Bank (2015 est.)\nMedian age:\ntotal: 18.4 years\nmale: 18.2 years\nfemale: 18.6 years (2015 est.)\nPopulation growth rate:\n2.81% (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  13\nBirth rate:\n31.11 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  37\nDeath rate:\n3.04 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  221\nNet migration rate:\n0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  96\nUrbanization:\nurban population: 75.3% of total population (2015)\nrate of urbanization: 2.81% annual rate of change (2005-10 est.)\nnote: data represents Gaza Strip and West Bank\nSex ratio:\nat birth: 1.06 male(s)/female\n0-14 years: 1.06 male(s)/female\n15-24 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n25-54 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n55-64 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n65 years and over: 0.71 male(s)/female\ntotal population: 1.04 male(s)/female (2015 est.)\nInfant mortality rate:\ntotal: 14.94 deaths/1,000 live births\nmale: 15.97 deaths/1,000 live births\nfemale: 13.86 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  105\nLife expectancy at birth:\ntotal population: 74.87 years\nmale: 73.11 years\nfemale: 76.74 years (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  110\nTotal fertility rate:\n4.08 children born/woman (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  35\nContraceptive prevalence rate:\n52.5% (includes Gaza Strip and the West Bank) (2010)\nPhysicians density:\n2.1 physicians/1,000 population (2013)\nHospital bed density:\n1.3 beds/1,000 population (2010)\nDrinking water source:\nimproved: \nurban: 50.7% of population\nrural: 81.5% of population\ntotal: 58.4% of population\nunimproved: \nurban: 49.3% of population\nrural: 18.5% of population\ntotal: 41.6% of population\n\nnote: includes Gaza and the West Bank (2015 est.)\nSanitation facility access:\nimproved: \nurban: 93% of population\nrural: 90.2% of population\ntotal: 92.3% of population\nunimproved: \nurban: 7% of population\nrural: 9.8% of population\ntotal: 7.7% of population\n\nnote: includes Gaza and the West Bank (2015 est.)\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate:\nNA\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS:\nNA\nHIV/AIDS - deaths:\nNA\nLiteracy:\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 96.5%\nmale: 98.4%\nfemale: 94.5%\nnote: estimates are for the Palestinian Territories (2015 est.)\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education):\ntotal: 13 years\nmale: 12 years\nfemale: 14 years\nnote: data represents Gaza and West Bank (2013)\nUnemployment, youth ages 15-24:\ntotal: 38.8%\nmale: 34.5%\nfemale: 62.2%\nnote: includes West Bank (2012 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  14\n"}}}
