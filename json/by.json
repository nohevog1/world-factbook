The economy is predominantly agricultural; agriculture accounts for just over 40% of GDP and employs more than 90% of the population. Burundi's primary exports are coffee and tea, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings, though exports are a relatively small share of GDP. Therefore, Burundi's export earnings - and its ability to pay for imports - rests primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices. An ethnic-based war that lasted until 2005 resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 140,000 others internally. Food, medicine, and electricity remain in short supply. Burundi's GDP grew around 4% annually in 2006-14. Political stability and the end of the civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has increased, but underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate, poor education rates, a weak legal system, a poor transportation network, overburdened utilities, and low administrative capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms. Government corruption is hindering the development of a healthy private sector as companies have to deal with ever changing rules. The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation. Burundi will remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors - foreign aid represents 42% of Burundi's national income, the second highest rate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Burundi joined the East African Community (EAC) in 2009, and regional infrastructure improvements driven by the EAC and funded by the World Bank may help improve Burundi’s transport connections and lower transportation costs."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"capital goods, petroleum products, foodstuffs"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"40.3%","industry":"17.1%","services":"42.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$705.8 million (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"169"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"coffee, tea, sugar, cotton, hides"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"4.1%","highest 10%":"28% (2006)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Lake Tanganyika 772 m","highest point":"Heha 2,670 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"3 30 S, 30 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"12.54 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.29  cu km/yr (15%/5%/79%)","per capita":"43.27  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"soil erosion as a result of overgrazing and the expansion of agriculture into marginal lands;
