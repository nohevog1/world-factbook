A large percentage of the population, especially in rural areas, derives its living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis. Because of the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic measures are difficult to obtain. On a per capita basis, real income has stagnated at 1980 levels. The economy grew rapidly between 2003 and 2008 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay's commodity-based export expansion. Paraguay is the sixth largest soy producer in the world. Drought hit in 2008, reducing agricultural exports and slowing the economy even before the onset of the global recession. The economy fell 3.8% in 2009, as lower world demand and commodity prices caused exports to contract. The government reacted by introducing fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. Growth resumed at a 13% level in 2010, the highest in South America, but slowed in 2011-13 as the stimulus subsided and severe drought and outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease led to a drop in beef and other agricultural exports. The economy took another leap in 2014, largely due to strong export growth. Political uncertainty, corruption, limited progress on structural reform, and deficient infrastructure are the main obstacles to long-term growth."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$42 million (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"108"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"road vehicles, consumer goods, tobacco, petroleum products, electrical machinery, tractors, chemicals, vehicle parts"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"19.9%","industry":"17.6%","services":"62.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$7.291 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"106"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"soybeans, livestock feed, cotton, meat, edible oils, wood, leather"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"1%","highest 10%":"41.1% (2010 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"junction of Rio Paraguay and Rio Parana 46 m","highest point":"Cerro Pero 842 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"23 00 S, 58 00 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"336 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.49  cu km/yr (20%/8%/71%)","per capita":"88.05  cu m/yr (2000)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation;
