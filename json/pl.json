The unemployment rate is now below the EU average. The government of Prime Minister Donald TUSK steered the Polish economy through the economic downturn by skillfully managing public finances and adopting controversial pension and tax reforms to further shore up public finances. While the Polish economy has performed well over the past five years, growth slowed in 2013 and picked back up in 2014. Short-term, the key policy challenge will be to consolidate debt and spending without stifling economic growth. Over the longer term, Poland's economic performance could improve if the country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and rail infrastructure, business environment, rigid labor code, commercial court system, government red tape, and burdensome tax system, especially for entrepreneurs.  Poland’s long-term challenges include diversifying Poland’s energy mix and sources of supply, as well as stemming the outflow of educated young Poles to other EU Member States, especially in light of a coming demographic contraction as the Solidarity-era baby boom generation ages."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$190.2 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"35"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and transport equipment 38%, intermediate manufactured goods 21%, chemicals 15%, minerals, fuels, lubricants, and related materials 9% (2011 est.)"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"3.7%","industry":"32%","services":"64.3% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$377.9 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"30"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and transport equipment 37.8%, intermediate manufactured goods 23.7%, miscellaneous manufactured goods 17.1%, food and live animals 7.6% (2012 est.)"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.3%","highest 10%":"27.1% (2009 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"near Raczki Elblaskie -2 m","highest point":"Rysy 2,499 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"52 00 N, 20 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"61.6 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"11.96  cu km/yr (31%/60%/10%)","per capita":"312.3  cu m/yr (2009)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"decreased emphasis on heavy industry and increased environmental concern by post-communist governments has improved environment;

By the mid-16th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ruled a vast tract of land in central and eastern Europe. During the 18th century, internal disorders weakened the nation, and in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \"Solidarity\" that over time became a political force with over 10 million members. Free elections in 1989 and 1990 won Solidarity control of the parliament and the presidency, bringing the communist era to a close. A \"shock therapy\" program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. With its transformation to a democratic, market-oriented country largely completed and with large investments in defense, energy, and other infrastructure, Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"WARSAW (capital) 1.722 million;
