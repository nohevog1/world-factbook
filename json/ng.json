Agriculture contributes nearly 40% of GDP and provides livelihood for most of the population. The UN ranked Niger as the least developed country in the world in 2014 due to multiple factors such as food insecurity, lack of industry, high population growth, a weak educational sector, and few prospects for work outside of subsistence farming and herding. Since 2011 public debt has increased in part from a large loan financing a new uranium mine. The government relies on foreign donor resources for a large portion of its fiscal budget. The economy in recent years has been hurt by terrorist activity and kidnappings near its uranium mines and instability in Mali, and concerns about security have boosted fiscal spending on defense. Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources. Niger has sizable reserves of oil and oil production. Food insecurity and drought remain perennial problems for Niger, and the government plans to invest more in the agriculture sector, most notably irrigation. The mining sector may be affected by the government’s attempt to renegotiate extraction rights contracts to increase royalty rates and reduce tax exemptions. Despite Niger’s three-year $121 million IMF Extended Credit Facility agreement for years 2012-15, formal private sector investment needed for economic diversification and growth remains a challenge, given the country’s limited domestic markets, access to credit, and competitiveness."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"foodstuffs, machinery, vehicles and parts, petroleum, cereals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"37.7%","industry":"18.6%","services":"43.7% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$2.313 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"142"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"uranium ore, livestock, cowpeas, onions"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.7%","highest 10%":"28.5% (2007)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Niger River 200 m","highest point":"Idoukal-n-Taghes 2,022 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"16 00 N, 8 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"33.65 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.98  cu km/yr (30%/3%/67%)","per capita":"70.53  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"overgrazing;

Ali SAIBOU was forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections, which resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999, BARE was killed in a counter coup by military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year. TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a constitutional amendment that would allow him to extend his term as president. In February 2010, a military coup deposed TANDJA, immediately suspended the constitution, and dissolved the Cabinet. ISSOUFOU Mahamadou emerged victorious from a crowded field in the election following the coup and was inaugurated in April 2011. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource base. The largely agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. The Nigerien Movement for Justice, a predominantly ethnic Tuareg rebel group, emerged in February 2007, and attacked several military targets in Niger's northern region throughout 2007 and 2008. Successful government offensives in 2009 ended the rebellion. Niger is facing increased security concerns on its borders from various external threats including insecurity in Libya, spillover from the conflict in Mali, and violent extremism in northeastern Nigeria."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"NIAMEY (capital) 1.09 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"49.57% (male 4,512,526/female 4,431,944)","15-24 years":"18.61% (male 1,658,537/female 1,699,924)","25-54 years":"25.92% (male 2,336,655/female 2,341,599)","55-64 years":"3.26% (male 305,363/female 283,647)","65 years and over":"2.64% (male 242,025/female 233,509) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"113%","youth dependency ratio":"107.5%","elderly dependency ratio":"5.5%","potential support ratio":"18.2% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"3,400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"42"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.02 physicians/1,000 population (2008)"},"Languages":{"value":"French (official), Hausa, Djerma"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 89.1% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"13.9% (2012)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"40,500 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"60"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-0.56 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"138"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 80%, other (includes indigenous beliefs and Christian) 20%"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"6.5% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"74"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 41.8% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"3.7% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"180"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Nigerien(s)","adjective":"Nigerien"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Haoussa 55.4%, Djerma Sonrai 21%, Tuareg 9.3%, Peuhl 8.5%, Kanouri Manga 4.7%, other 1.2% (2001 census)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"0.31 beds/1,000 population (2005)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.02 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.98 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1.08 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"1.04 male(s)/female","total population":"1.01 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"15.2 years","male":"15.1 years","female":"15.3 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"18,045,729 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"62"},"Birth rate":{"value":"45.45 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"1"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"4.4% of GDP (2012)","country comparison to the world":"101"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"37.9% (2012)","country comparison to the world":"4"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"1,557,913","percentage":"43% (2006 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"5 years","male":"6 years","female":"5 years (2012)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"19.1%","male":"27.3%","female":"11% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"6.76 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"1"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.49% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"68"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"55.13 years","male":"53.9 years","female":"56.39 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"209"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"84.59 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"89.12 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"79.92 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"7"},"Death rate":{"value":"12.42 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"23"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"18.7% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"5.14% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"3.25% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"4"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"malaria and dengue fever","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","respiratory disease":"meningococcal meningitis","animal contact disease":"rabies","note":"highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been identified in this country; it poses a negligible risk with extremely rare cases possible among US citizens who have close contact with birds (2013)"}}}
