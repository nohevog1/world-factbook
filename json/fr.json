The government has partially or fully privatized many large companies, including Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. However, the government maintains a strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public transport, and defense industries. With more than 84 million foreign tourists per year, France is the most visited country in the world and maintains the third largest income in the world from tourism. France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies, and social spending that mitigate economic inequality. France's real GDP increased by 0.4% in 2014. The unemployment rate (including overseas territories) increased from 7.8% in 2008 to 10.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Youth unemployment in metropolitan France decreased from a high of 25.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 24.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Lower-than-expected growth and high spending have strained France's public finances. The budget deficit rose sharply from 3.3% of GDP in 2008 to 7.5% of GDP in 2009 before improving to 4% of GDP in 2014, while France's public debt rose from 68% of GDP to more than 95% in 2014, and may hit 100% by 2016. Elected on a conventionally leftist platform, President Francois HOLLANDE surprised and angered many supporters with a January 2014 speech announcing a sharp change in his economic policy, recasting himself as a liberalizing reformer. The government's budget for 2014 shifted the balance of fiscal consolidation from taxes to a total of $24 billion in spending cuts. In December 2014, HOLLANDE announced additional reforms, including a plan to extend commercial business hours, liberalize professional services, and sell off $6.2-12.4 billion in state owned assets. Franceâ€™s tax burden remains well above the EU average and income tax cuts over the past decade are being partly reversed, particularly for higher earners. The top rate of income tax is 41%. The government is allowing a 75% payroll tax on salaries over $1.24 million to lapse."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$1.983 trillion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"8"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, vehicles, crude oil, aircraft, plastics, chemicals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"1.7%","industry":"19.4%","services":"78.9% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$5.004 trillion (31 December 2011)","country comparison to the world":"5"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and transportation equipment, aircraft, plastics, chemicals, pharmaceutical products, iron and steel, beverages"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.6%","highest 10%":"25.4% (2013)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Rhone River delta -2 m","highest point":"Mont Blanc 4,807 m","note":"to assess the possible effects of climate change on the ice and snow cap of Mont Blanc, its surface and peak have been extensively measured in recent years;

It plays an influential global role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-8, the G-20, the EU and other multilateral organizations. France rejoined NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009, reversing DE GAULLE's 1966 decision to withdraw French forces from NATO. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely parliamentary administrations. In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century, five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"PARIS (capital) 10.843 million; Lyon 1.609 million; Marseille-Aix-en-Provence 1.605 million; Lille 1.027 million; Nice-Cannes 967,000; Toulouse 938,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"18.66% (male 6,350,008/female 6,066,407)","15-24 years":"11.82% (male 4,025,283/female 3,842,989)","25-54 years":"38.31% (male 12,823,675/female 12,671,013)","55-64 years":"12.48% (male 4,008,672/female 4,294,218)","65 years and over":"18.74% (male 5,360,078/female 7,111,423) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"60.3%","youth dependency ratio":"29.6%","elderly dependency ratio":"30.6%","potential support ratio":"3.3% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"1,500 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"59"},"Physicians density":{"value":"3.19 physicians/1,000 population (2013)"},"Languages":{"value":"French (official) 100%, rapidly declining regional dialects and languages (Provencal, Breton, Alsatian, Corsican, Catalan, Basque, Flemish)","overseas departments":"French, Creole patois, Mahorian (a Swahili dialect)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 1.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"76.4%","note":"percent of women aged 20-49 (2008)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"1.09 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"62"},"Religions":{"value":"Christian (overwhelmingly Roman Catholic) 63-66%, Muslim 7-9%, Jewish .5-.75%, Buddhist .5-.75%, other .5-1.0%, none 23-28%","note":"France maintains a tradition of secularism and has not officially collected data on religious affiliation since the 1872 national census, which complicates assessments of France's religious composition; an 1872 law prohibiting state authorities from collecting data on individuals' ethnicity or religious beliefs was reaffirmed by a 1978 law emphasizing the prohibition of the collection or exploitation of personal data revealing an individual's race, ethnicity, or political, philosophical, or religious opinions; a 1905 law codified France's separation of Church and State (2015 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"23.8%","male":"23.9%","female":"23.7% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"39"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"11.7% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"9"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"25.7% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"108"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Frenchman(men), Frenchwoman(women)","adjective":"French"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Celtic and Latin with Teutonic, Slavic, North African, Indochinese, Basque minorities","overseas departments":"black, white, mulatto, East Indian, Chinese, Amerindian"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"6.4 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.93 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.75 male(s)/female","total population":"0.96 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"41.1 years","male":"39.4 years","female":"42.6 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"66,553,766","note":"the above figure is for metropolitan France and five overseas regions; the metropolitan France population is 62,814,233 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"22"},"Birth rate":{"value":"12.38 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"160"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"5.9% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"43"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"16 years","male":"16 years","female":"16 years (2012)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.08 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"110"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"81.75 years","male":"78.65 years","female":"85.01 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"19"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"3.28 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"3.6 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"2.94 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"213"},"Death rate":{"value":"9.16 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"65"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"79.5% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.84% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.43% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"163"}}}
