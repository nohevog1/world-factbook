It acquired fame as the place of Napoleon BONAPARTE's exile from 1815 until his death in 1821, but its importance as a port of call declined after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. During the Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, several thousand Boer prisoners were confined on the island between 1900 and 1903.","Ascension Island":"This barren and uninhabited island was discovered and named by the Portuguese in 1503. The British garrisoned the island in 1815 to prevent a rescue of Napoleon from Saint Helena. It served as a provisioning station for the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron on anti-slavery patrol. The island remained under Admiralty control until 1922, when it became a dependency of Saint Helena. During World War II, the UK permitted the US to construct an airfield on Ascension in support of transatlantic flights to Africa and anti-submarine operations in the South Atlantic. In the 1960s the island became an important space tracking station for the US. In 1982, Ascension was an essential staging area for British forces during the Falklands War. It remains a critical refueling point in the air-bridge from the UK to the South Atlantic.","Tristan da Cunha":"The island group consists of Tristan da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible, and Gough Islands. Tristan da Cunha is named after its Portuguese discoverer (1506); it was garrisoned by the British in 1816 to prevent any attempt to rescue Napoleon from Saint Helena. Gough and Inaccessible Islands have been designated World Heritage Sites. South Africa leases a site for a meteorological station on Gough Island."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"JAMESTOWN (capital) 1,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"16.55% (male 658/female 632)","15-24 years":"12.06% (male 479/female 461)","25-54 years":"44.67% (male 1,719/female 1,763)","55-64 years":"12.6% (male 519/female 463)","65 years and over":"14.12% (male 560/female 541) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Languages":{"value":"English"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"84"},"Religions":{"value":"Protestant (Anglican (majority), Baptist, Seventh-Day Adventist), Roman Catholic"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Saint Helenian(s)","adjective":"Saint Helenian","note":"referred to locally as \"Saints\""},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"African descent 50%, white 25%, Chinese 25%"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.98 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1.12 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"1.04 male(s)/female","total population":"1.02 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"41 years","male":"41 years","female":"41 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"7,795","note":"only Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha islands are inhabited, not any of the other nearby islands/islets (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"226"},"Birth rate":{"value":"9.88 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"197"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.58 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"185"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"79.36 years","male":"76.42 years","female":"82.44 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"45"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"14.19 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"16.75 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"11.5 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"107"},"Death rate":{"value":"7.44 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"114"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"39.4% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"-0.59% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.24% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"179"}}}
