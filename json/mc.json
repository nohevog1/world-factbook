Macau's gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by China's decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens wishing to visit Macau. In 2014, Macau's gaming-related taxes accounted for more than 83% of total government revenue. Macau's economy slowed dramatically in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown, but strong growth resumed in 2010-13, largely on the back of tourism from mainland China and the gaming sectors. In 2014, this city of 636,200 hosted nearly 31.5 million visitors. Almost 67% came from mainland China. Macau's traditional manufacturing industry has slowed greatly since the termination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. Services export — primarily gaming — increasingly has driven Macau’s economic performance. Mainland China’s ongoing anti-corruption campaign has brought Macau’s gambling boom to a halt, with spending in casinos contracting 2.6% in 2014. As a result, Macau's inflation-adjusted GDP contracted 0.4% from 2013, down from double-digit expansion rates in 2010-13. Non-inflation adjusted exports of goods and services dropped 0.4% from 2013, reflecting the slowdown in gaming exports. Macau continues to face the challenges of managing its growing casino industry, risks from money-laundering activities, and the need to diversify the economy away from heavy dependence on gaming revenues. Macau's currency, the pataca, is closely tied to the Hong Kong dollar, which is also freely accepted in the territory."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$2.3 billion (31 December 2008 est.)","country comparison to the world":"44"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, consumer goods (foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco, garments and footwear, motor vehicles), capital goods, mineral fuels and oils"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"0%","industry":"5.9%","services":"94.1% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$0 (31 December 2012)","country comparison to the world":"205"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, electronics, machinery and parts"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"South China Sea 0 m","highest point":"Coloane Alto 172 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"22 10 N, 113 33 E"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Marine Dumping (associate member), Ship Pollution (associate member)"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"NA"},"Location":{"value":"Eastern Asia, bordering the South China Sea and China"},"Geography - note":{"value":"essentially urban;
