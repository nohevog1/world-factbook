A wide range of important mineral resources are found in the mountainous and coastal areas, and Peru's coastal waters provide excellent fishing grounds. Peru is the world's second largest producer of silver and third largest producer of copper. The Peruvian economy grew by an average of 5.6% from 2009-13 with a stable exchange rate and low inflation, which in 2013 was just below the upper limit of the Central Bank target range of 1 to 3%. This growth was due partly to high international prices for Peru's metals and minerals exports, which account for almost 60% of the country's total exports. Growth slipped in 2014, due to weaker world prices for these resources. Despite Peru's strong macroeconomic performance, dependence on minerals and metals exports and imported foodstuffs makes the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices. Peru's rapid expansion coupled with cash transfers and other programs have helped to reduce the national poverty rate by 28 percentage points since 2002, but inequality persists and continues to pose a challenge for the Ollanta HUMALA administration, which has championed a policy of social inclusion and a more equitable distribution of income. Poor infrastructure hinders the spread of growth to Peru's non-coastal areas. The HUMALA administration passed several economic stimulus packages in 2014 to bolster growth, including reforms to environmental regulations in order to spur investment in Peruâ€™s lucrative mining sector, a move that was opposed by some environmental groups. Peru's free trade policy has continued under the HUMALA administration; since 2006, Peru has signed trade deals with the US, Canada, Singapore, China, Korea, Mexico, Japan, the EU, the European Free Trade Association, Chile, Thailand, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, concluded negotiations with Guatemala, and begun trade talks with Honduras, El Salvador, India, Indonesia, Turkey and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Peru also has signed a trade pact with Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, called the Pacific Alliance, that seeks integration of services, capital, investment and movement of people.  Since the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement entered into force in February 2009, total trade between Peru and the United States has doubled."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$160.9 billion (31 December 2010)","country comparison to the world":"38"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, plastics, machinery, vehicles, TV sets, power shovels, front-end loaders, telephones and telecommunication equipment, iron and steel, wheat, corn, soybean products, paper, cotton, vaccines and medicines"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"7.1%","industry":"36.7%","services":"56.2% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$55.62 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"60"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"copper, gold, lead, zinc, tin, iron ore, molybdenum, silver;

Peruvian independence was declared in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces were defeated in 1824. After a dozen years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic leadership in 1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless, the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime, which led to his resignation in 2000. A caretaker government oversaw a new election in the spring of 2001, which installed Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of government - Peru's first democratically elected president of indigenous ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the return of Alan GARCIA Perez who, after a disappointing presidential term from 1985 to 1990, oversaw a robust economic rebound. In June 2011, former army officer Ollanta HUMALA Tasso was elected president; he has carried on the sound, market-oriented economic policies of the three preceding administrations."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"LIMA (capital) 9.897 million; Arequipa 850,000; Trujillo 798,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"26.95% (male 4,174,434/female 4,029,691)","15-24 years":"18.93% (male 2,884,314/female 2,877,403)","25-54 years":"39.65% (male 5,801,997/female 6,268,941)","55-64 years":"7.45% (male 1,103,641/female 1,164,821)","65 years and over":"7.03% (male 1,013,806/female 1,125,951) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"53.2%","youth dependency ratio":"42.7%","elderly dependency ratio":"10.5%","potential support ratio":"9.6% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"2,500 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"51"},"Physicians density":{"value":"1.13 physicians/1,000 population (2012)"},"Languages":{"value":"Spanish (official) 84.1%, Quechua (official) 13%, Aymara (official) 1.7%, Ashaninka 0.3%, other native languages (includes a large number of minor Amazonian languages) 0.7%, other (includes foreign languages and sign language) 0.2% (2007 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 23.8% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"75.5% (2012)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"71,900 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"51"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-2.53 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"174"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 81.3%, Evangelical 12.5%, other 3.3%, none 2.9% (2007 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"9.5%","male":"9.4%","female":"9.7% (2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"101"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"5.3% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"140"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 13.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Demographic profile":{"value":"Peru was a country of immigration in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but has become a country of emigration in the last few decades.
