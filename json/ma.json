The free market strategy had previously placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low starting point. Exports of apparel boomed after gaining duty-free access to the US in 2000; however, Madagascar's failure to comply with the requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) led to the termination of the country's duty-free access in January 2010, a sharp fall in textile production, and a loss of more than 100,000 jobs; Madagascar regained AGOA access in January 2015 following the democratic election of a new President the previous year. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing roughly 80% of the population. Deforestation and erosion, aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel, are serious concerns. Many investors remain wary of investing for fear of a return to political instability in the country and because of weaknesses in the business environment. Expansion in mining and agricultural sectors contributed to growth in 2014. International organizations and foreign donors resumed development aid to Madagascar after RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA appointed a new government in mid-2014, however full-scale assistance will require further policy reforms, particularly on addressing rampant corruption."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"capital goods, petroleum, consumer goods, food"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"28.1%","industry":"17.4%","services":"54.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$3.282 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"137"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"coffee, vanilla, shellfish, sugar, cotton cloth, clothing, chromite, petroleum products"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.2%","highest 10%":"34.7% (2010 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Indian Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Maromokotro 2,876 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"20 00 S, 47 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"337 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"16.5  cu km/yr (2%/1%/97%)","per capita":"1,010  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"soil erosion results from deforestation and overgrazing;

During 1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections were held ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, was returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country. In April 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner. RAVALOMANANA achieved a second term following a landslide victory in the generally free and fair presidential election of 2006. In early 2009, protests over increasing restrictions on opposition press and activities resulted in RAVALOMANANA handing over power to the military, which then conferred the presidency on the mayor of Antananarivo, Andry RAJOELINA, in what amounted to a coup d'etat. Following a lengthy mediation process led by the Southern African Development Community, Madagascar held UN-supported presidential and parliamentary elections in 2013. Former de facto finance minister Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA won a runoff election in December 2013 and was inaugurated in January 2014."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"ANTANANARIVO (capital) 2.61 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"40.45% (male 4,856,231/female 4,775,025)","15-24 years":"20.53% (male 2,450,164/female 2,439,035)","25-54 years":"31.56% (male 3,760,230/female 3,755,775)","55-64 years":"4.24% (male 488,315/female 521,690)","65 years and over":"3.22% (male 347,151/female 419,065) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"80.3%","youth dependency ratio":"75.2%","elderly dependency ratio":"5.1%","potential support ratio":"19.5% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"3,200 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"43"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.16 physicians/1,000 population (2007)"},"Languages":{"value":"French (official), Malagasy (official), English"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 88% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"39.9% (2008/09)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"39,100 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"62"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"90"},"Religions":{"value":"indigenous beliefs 52%, Christian 41%, Muslim 7%"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"2.3%","male":"1.7%","female":"2.8% (2005 est.)","country comparison to the world":"133"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"4.2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"158"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 48.5% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"4.6% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"187"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Malagasy (singular and plural)","adjective":"Malagasy"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Malayo-Indonesian (Merina and related Betsileo), Cotiers (mixed African, Malayo-Indonesian, and Arab ancestry - Betsimisaraka, Tsimihety, Antaisaka, Sakalava), French, Indian, Creole, Comoran"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"0.2 beds/1,000 population (2010)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.02 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.94 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.83 male(s)/female","total population":"1 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"19.4 years","male":"19.2 years","female":"19.5 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"23,812,681 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"52"},"Birth rate":{"value":"32.61 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"33"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"2.7% of GDP (2012)","country comparison to the world":"150"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"1,827,423","percentage":"28%","note":"data represents children ages 5-17 (2007 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"10 years","male":"11 years","female":"10 years (2012)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"64.7%","male":"66.7%","female":"62.6% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"4.2 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"33"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.29% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"82"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"65.55 years","male":"64.09 years","female":"67.05 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"175"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"43.67 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"47.59 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"39.63 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"47"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.81 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"138"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"35.1% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"4.69% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"2.58% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"21"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"malaria and dengue fever","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
