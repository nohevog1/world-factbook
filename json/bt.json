Because rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive, industrial production is primarily of the cottage industry type. The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links and is dependent on India for financial assistance and migrant laborers for development projects, especially for road construction. Multilateral development organizations administer most educational, social, and environment programs, and take into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Complicated controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. Bhutan’s largest export - hydropower to India - could spur sustainable growth in the coming years if Bhutan resolves chronic delays in construction. Bhutan currently taps only 5% of its 30,000-megawatt hydropower potential and is behind schedule in building 12 new hydropower dams with a combined capacity of 10,000 megawatts by 2020 in accordance with a deal signed in 2008 with India.  The high volume of imported materials to build hydropower plants has expanded Bhutan's trade and current account deficits. However, Bhutan and India in April 2014 agreed to begin four additional hydropower projects, which would generate 2,120 megawatts in total. A declining GDP growth rate in each of the past three years in the absence of new hydropower facilities has constrained Bhutan’s ability to institute economic reforms. Bhutan inked a pact in December 2014 to expand duty-free trade with Bangladesh, the only trade partner with which Bhutan enjoys a surplus."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$283.4 million (31 December 2012)","country comparison to the world":"115"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"fuel and lubricants, passenger cars, machinery and parts, fabrics, rice"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"14.4%","industry":"41.6%","services":"44% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$1.578 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"150"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"electricity (to India), ferrosilicon, cement, calcium carbide, copper wire, manganese, vegetable oil"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.3%","highest 10%":"37.6% (2003)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Drangeme Chhu 97 m","highest point":"Gangkar Puensum 7,570 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"27 30 N, 90 30 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"78 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.34  cu km/yr (5%/1%/94%)","per capita":"458  cu m/yr (2008)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection","signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"soil erosion; limited access to potable water"},"Location":{"value":"Southern Asia, between China and India"},"Geography - note":{"value":"landlocked; strategic location between China and India; controls several key Himalayan mountain passes"},"Coastline":{"value":"0 km (landlocked)"},"Land boundaries":{"total":"1,136 km","border countries (2)":"China 477 km, India 659 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Asia"},"Natural resources":{"value":"timber, hydropower, gypsum, calcium carbonate"},"Terrain":{"value":"mostly mountainous with some fertile valleys and savanna"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"about one-half the size of Indiana"},"Climate":{"value":"varies; tropical in southern plains; cool winters and hot summers in central valleys; severe winters and cool summers in Himalayas"},"Land use":{"agricultural land":"13.6%","value":"arable land 2.6%; permanent crops 0.3%; permanent pasture 10.7%","forest":"85.5%","other":"0.9% (2011 est.)"},"Maritime claims":{"value":"none (landlocked)"},"Irrigated land":{"value":"319.1 sq km (2010)"},"Natural hazards":{"value":"violent storms from the Himalayas are the source of the country's name, which translates as Land of the Thunder Dragon; frequent landslides during the rainy season"},"Area":{"total":"38,394 sq km","land":"38,394 sq km","water":"0 sq km","country comparison to the world":"137"}},"Transportation":{"Airports":{"value":"2 (2013)","country comparison to the world":"198"},"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":"2","1,524 to 2,437 m":"1","914 to 1,523 m":"1 (2013)"},"Airports - with unpaved runways":{"total":"1","914 to 1,523 m":"1 (2012)"},"Roadways":{"total":"10,578 km","paved":"2,975 km (includes 2,180 km of natonal highways)","unpaved":"7,603 km (2013)","country comparison to the world":"135"}},"Military":{"Military branches":{"value":"Royal Bhutan Army (includes Royal Bodyguard and Royal Bhutan Police) (2009)"},"Military service age and obligation":{"value":"18 years of age for voluntary military service; no conscription; militia training is compulsory for males aged 20-25, over a 3-year period (2012)"},"Manpower available for military service":{"males age 16-49":"202,407","females age 16-49":"180,349 (2010 est.)"},"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":"157,664","females age 16-49":"144,861 (2010 est.)"},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":"7,363","female":"7,095 (2010 est.)"}},"Transnational Issues":{"Disputes - international":{"value":"lacking any treaty describing the boundary, Bhutan and China continue negotiations to establish a common boundary alignment to resolve territorial disputes arising from substantial cartographic discrepancies, the largest of which lie in Bhutan's northwest and along the Chumbi salient"}},"Government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Kingdom of Bhutan","conventional short form":"Bhutan","local long form":"Druk Gyalkhap","local short form":"Druk Yul"},"Government type":{"value":"constitutional monarchy"},"Diplomatic representation in the US":{"value":"none; note - the Permanent Mission to the UN for Bhutan has consular jurisdiction in the US; the permanent representative to the UN is Kunzang C.
