The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the EU) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. Since 2008, Liechtenstein has faced renewed international pressure - particularly from Germany and the United States - to improve transparency in its banking and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein's conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD in October 2009 removed the principality from its \"grey list\" of countries that had yet to implement the organization's Model Tax Convention. By the end of 2010, Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange Agreements or Double Tax Agreements. In 2011 Liechtenstein joined the Schengen area, which allows passport-free travel across 26 European countries."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"agricultural products, raw materials, energy products, machinery, metal goods, textiles, foodstuffs, motor vehicles"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"8%","industry":"37%","services":"55% (2009)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$0 (2001)","note":"public external debt only;

Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic Wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money laundering. However, Liechtenstein implemented anti-money laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US that went into effect in 2003."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"VADUZ (capital) 5,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"15.54% (male 3,142/female 2,706)","15-24 years":"11.73% (male 2,182/female 2,230)","25-54 years":"42.65% (male 8,013/female 8,035)","55-64 years":"13.58% (male 2,504/female 2,606)","65 years and over":"16.49% (male 2,837/female 3,369) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Languages":{"value":"German 94.5% (official) (Alemannic is the main dialect), Italian 1.1%, other 4.3% (2010 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"5.08 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"26"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic (official) 75.9%, Protestant Reformed 6.5%, Muslim 5.4%, Lutheran 1.3%, other 2.9%, none 5.4%, unspecified 2.6% (2010 est.)"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Liechtensteiner(s)","adjective":"Liechtenstein"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Liechtensteiner 65.6%, other 34.4% (2000 census)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.26 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.16 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.98 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.96 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.84 male(s)/female","total population":"0.99 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"42.7 years","male":"41.5 years","female":"43.8 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"37,624 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"214"},"Birth rate":{"value":"10.45 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"187"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"2.1% of GDP (2008)","country comparison to the world":"166"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"15 years","male":"16 years","female":"14 years (2012)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.69 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"173"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"81.77 years","male":"79.6 years","female":"84.5 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"16"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"4.29 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"4.59 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"3.92 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"189"},"Death rate":{"value":"7.12 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"128"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"14.3% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.48% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.84% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"130"}}}
