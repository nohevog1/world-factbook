For the last decade, high oil prices have generated budget surpluses despite increasing budget expenditures, particularly on wage hikes for public sector employees. Despite Kuwaitâ€™s dependence on oil, the government has cushioned itself against the impact of lower oil prices by continuous saving of at least 10% of government revenue in the Fund for Future Generations. Kuwait has done little to diversify its economy, in part, due to a poor business climate and an acrimonious relationship between the National Assembly and the executive branch that has stymied most economic reforms. In 2010, Kuwait passed its first long-term economic development plan in almost twenty-five years. While the government planned to spend up $104 billion over four years to diversify the economy away from oil, attract more investment, and boost private sector participation in the economy, many of the projects did not materialize because of the uncertain political situation."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$119.6 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"43"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"food, construction materials, vehicles and parts, clothing"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"0.3%","industry":"49.4%","services":"50.2% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$33.96 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"71"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"oil and refined products, fertilizers"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Persian Gulf 0 m","highest point":"unnamed elevation 306 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"29 30 N, 45 45 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"0.02 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.91  cu km/yr (47%/2%/51%)","per capita":"441.2  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection","signed, but not ratified":"Marine Dumping"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"limited natural freshwater resources;

Kuwait was attacked and overrun by Iraq on 2 August 1990. Following several weeks of aerial bombardment, a US-led, UN coalition began a ground assault on 23 February 1991 that liberated Kuwait in four days. Kuwait spent more than $5 billion to repair oil infrastructure damaged during 1990-91. The AL-SABAH family has ruled since returning to power in 1991 and reestablished an elected legislature that in recent years has become increasingly assertive. The country witnessed the historic election in 2009 of four women to its National Assembly. Amid the 2010-11 uprisings and protests across the Arab world, stateless Arabs, known as bidun, staged small protests in February and March 2011 demanding citizenship, jobs, and other benefits available to Kuwaiti nationals. Youth activist groups - supported by opposition legislators - rallied repeatedly in 2011 for the prime minister's dismissal amid allegations of widespread government corruption. Demonstrators forced the prime minister to resign in late 2011. In late 2012, Kuwait witnessed unprecedented protests in response to the Amir's changes to the electoral law by decree reducing the number of votes per person from four to one. The opposition, led by a coalition of Sunni Islamists, tribalists, some liberals, and myriad youth groups, largely boycotted legislative elections in 2012 and 2013 ushering in legislatures more amenable to the government's agenda. Since 2006, the Amir has dissolved the National Assembly on five occasions (the Constitutional Court annulled the Assembly in June 2012 and again in June 2013) and shuffled the cabinet over a dozen times, usually citing political stagnation and gridlock between the legislature and the government."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"KUWAIT (capital) 2.779 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"25.32% (male 367,176/female 338,883)","15-24 years":"15.21% (male 233,306/female 190,903)","25-54 years":"52.32% (male 924,103/female 534,769)","55-64 years":"4.82% (male 76,707/female 57,663)","65 years and over":"2.33% (male 30,681/female 34,343) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"32.1%","youth dependency ratio":"29.5%","elderly dependency ratio":"2.6%","potential support ratio":"38.4% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Physicians density":{"value":"1.79 physicians/1,000 population (2009)"},"Languages":{"value":"Arabic (official), English widely spoken"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 100% of population","unimproved":"","urban:":"0% of population","rural:":"0% of population","total:":"0% of population (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-1.58 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"158"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim (official) 76.7%, Christian 17.3%, other and unspecified 5.9%","note":"represents the total population; about 69% of the population consists of immigrants (2013 est.)","religious affiliation":" "},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"11.3%","male":"11.8%","female":"10% (2005 est.)","country comparison to the world":"94"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"2.9% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"187"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 1% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"38.3% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"10"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Kuwaiti(s)","adjective":"Kuwaiti"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Kuwaiti 31.3%, other Arab 27.9%, Asian 37.8%, African 1.9%, other 1.1% (includes European, North American, South American, and Australian) (2013 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"2.2 beds/1,000 population (2012)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.08 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.22 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.73 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1.33 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.89 male(s)/female","total population":"1.41 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"29 years","male":"30.2 years","female":"27 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"2,788,534","note":"Kuwait's Public Authority for Civil Information estimates the country's total population to be 3,996,899 for 2014, with immigrants accounting for almost 69% (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"141"},"Birth rate":{"value":"19.91 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"84"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"3.8% of GDP (2006)","country comparison to the world":"116"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"2.2% (2012)","country comparison to the world":"120"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"96.3%","male":"96.5%","female":"95.8% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.48 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"80"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"77.82 years","male":"76.51 years","female":"79.19 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"64"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"7.31 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"7.09 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"7.54 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"158"},"Death rate":{"value":"2.18 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"223"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"98.3% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"3.63% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.62%","note":"this rate reflects a return to pre-Gulf crisis immigration of expatriates (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"73"}}}
