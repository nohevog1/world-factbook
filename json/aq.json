Economic activity is strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa conducts most of its commerce. Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the private sector with canned tuna the primary export. The two tuna canneries accounted for 13.1% of employment in 2013. In late September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting tsunami devastated American Samoa and nearby Samoa, disrupting transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency oversaw a relief program of nearly $25 million. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism is a promising developing sector. In 2015, a new fish processing company completed refurbishing the processing facilities left behind by one of the two canneries that closed in 2009 and opened a new cannery. With two operating canneries once again, fish processing and exports will rise in 2015 and beyond."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"raw materials for canneries, food, petroleum products, machinery and parts"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"27.4%","industry":"12.4%","services":"60.2% (2012)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$NA"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"canned tuna 93%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Lata Mountain 964 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"14 20 S, 170 00 W"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"limited natural freshwater resources; the water division of the government has spent substantial funds in the past few years to improve water catchments and pipelines"},"Location":{"value":"Oceania, group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean, about halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand"},"Geography - note":{"value":"Pago Pago has one of the best natural deepwater harbors in the South Pacific Ocean, sheltered by shape from rough seas and protected by peripheral mountains from high winds; strategic location in the South Pacific Ocean"},"Coastline":{"value":"116 km"},"Land boundaries":{"value":"0 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Oceania"},"Natural resources":{"value":"pumice, pumicite"},"Terrain":{"value":"five volcanic islands with rugged peaks and limited coastal plains, two coral atolls (Rose Island, Swains Island)"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"slightly larger than Washington, DC"},"Climate":{"value":"tropical marine, moderated by southeast trade winds; annual rainfall averages about 3 m; rainy season (November to April), dry season (May to October); little seasonal temperature variation"},"Land use":{"agricultural land":"21.7%","value":"arable land 13.3%; permanent crops 8.4%; permanent pasture 0%","forest":"78.3%","other":"0% (2011 est.)"},"Maritime claims":{"territorial sea":"12 nm","exclusive economic zone":"200 nm"},"Irrigated land":{"value":"NA"},"Natural hazards":{"value":"typhoons common from December to March","volcanism":"limited volcanic activity on the Ofu and Olosega Islands; neither has erupted since the 19th century"},"Area":{"total":"199 sq km","land":"199 sq km","water":"0 sq km","note":"includes Rose Island and Swains Island","country comparison to the world":"216"}},"Transportation":{"Airports":{"value":"3 (2013)","country comparison to the world":"192"},"Airports - with paved runways":{"total":"3","over 3,047 m":"1","914 to 1,523 m":"1","under 914 m":"1 (2013)"},"Roadways":{"total":"241 km (2008)","country comparison to the world":"207"},"Ports and terminals":{"major seaport(s)":"Pago Pago"}},"Military":{"Manpower fit for military service":{"males age 16-49":"14,562","females age 16-49":"14,129 (2010 est.)"},"Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually":{"male":"775","female":"762 (2010 est.)"},"Military - note":{"value":"defense is the responsibility of the US"}},"Transnational Issues":{"Disputes - international":{"value":"Tokelau included American Samoa's Swains Island (Olosega) in its 2006 draft independence constitution"}},"Government":{"Country name":{"conventional long form":"Territory of American Samoa","conventional short form":"American Samoa","abbreviation":"AS","note":"the name \"Samoa\" is composed of two parts, \"sa\" meaning sacred and \"moa\" meaning center, so the name can mean Holy Center; alternatively, it can mean \"place of the sacred moa bird\" of Polynesian mythology"},"Government type":{"value":"NA"},"Diplomatic representation in the US":{"value":"none (territory of the US)"},"Political parties and leaders":{"value":"Republican Party [Tautai A.
