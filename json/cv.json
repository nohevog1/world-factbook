The economy is service-oriented with commerce, transport, tourism, and public services accounting for about three-fourths of GDP. Tourism is the mainstay of the economy and depends on conditions in the euro zone countries. Although about 40% of the population lives in rural areas, the share of food production in GDP is low. The island economy suffers from a poor natural resource base, including serious water shortages, exacerbated by cycles of long-term drought, and poor soil for growing food on several of the islands, requiring it to import most of what it consumes. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cabo Verde annually runs a high trade deficit financed by foreign aid and remittances from its large pool of emigrants; remittances as a share of GDP are one of the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Economic reforms are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy and mitigate high unemployment. The government’s elevated debt levels have limited its capacity to finance any shortfalls."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"foodstuffs, industrial products, transport equipment, fuels"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"10%","industry":"18.6%","services":"71.4% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$1.421 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"153"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"fuel (re-exports), shoes, garments, fish, hides"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"1.9%","highest 10%":"40.6% (2001)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mt.

Cabo Verde subsequently became a trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. Following independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cabo Verde continues to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments. Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result, Cabo Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one. Most Cabo Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"PRAIA (capital) 145,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"30.1% (male 82,623/female 81,731)","15-24 years":"20.99% (male 57,307/female 57,303)","25-54 years":"38.53% (male 102,186/female 108,177)","55-64 years":"5.29% (male 12,194/female 16,709)","65 years and over":"5.08% (male 10,466/female 17,297) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"52%","youth dependency ratio":"45.1%","elderly dependency ratio":"7%","potential support ratio":"14.4% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"100 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"125"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.31 physicians/1,000 population (2011)"},"Languages":{"value":"Portuguese (official), Crioulo (a blend of Portuguese and West African words)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 27.8% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"61.3% (2005)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"3,400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"112"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-0.63 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"140"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 77.3%, Protestant 3.7% (includes Church of the Nazarene 1.7%, Adventist 1.5%, Universal Kingdom of God 0.4%, and God and Love 0.1%), other Christian 4.3% (includes Christian Rationalism 1.9%, Jehovah's Witness 1%, Assembly of God 0.9%, and New Apostolic 0.5%), Muslim 1.8%, other 1.3%, none 10.8%, unspecified 0.7% (2010 est.)"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"4.4% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"164"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 8.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"11.7% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"131"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Cabo Verdean(s)","adjective":"Cabo Verdean"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Creole (mulatto) 71%, African 28%, European 1%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"2.1 beds/1,000 population (2010)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.95 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.73 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.61 male(s)/female","total population":"0.94 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"24.5 years","male":"23.6 years","female":"25.3 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"545,993 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"174"},"Birth rate":{"value":"20.33 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"82"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"5% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"76"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"1,948","percentage":"3%","note":"data represent children ages 10-14 (2001 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"13 years","male":"13 years","female":"14 years (2013)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"87.6%","male":"92.1%","female":"83.1% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.29 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"93"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"1.09% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"44"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"71.85 years","male":"69.58 years","female":"74.19 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"147"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"23.45 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"26.89 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"19.91 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"76"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.11 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"161"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"65.5% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"1.99% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.36% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"87"}}}
