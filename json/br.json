Since 2003, Brazil has steadily improved its macroeconomic stability, building up foreign reserves, and reducing its debt profile by shifting its debt burden toward real denominated and domestically held instruments. Since 2008, Brazil became a net external creditor and all three of the major ratings agencies awarded investment grade status to its debt. After strong growth in 2007 and 2008, the onset of the global financial crisis hit Brazil in 2008. Brazil experienced two quarters of recession, as global demand for Brazil's commodity-based exports dwindled and external credit dried up. However, Brazil was one of the first emerging markets to begin a recovery. In 2010, consumer and investor confidence revived and GDP growth reached 7.5%, the highest growth rate in the past 25 years. After reaching historic lows of 4.5% in early 2014, the unemployment rate remains low, but is rising.  Brazil's traditionally high level of income inequality has declined for each of the last 15 years. GDP growth has slowed since 2011, due to several factors, including: overdependence on exports of raw commodities, low productivity, high operational costs, persistently high inflation, and low levels of investment. Brazil's fiscal and current account balances have eroded during the past four years as the government attempted to boost economic growth through targeted tax cuts for industry and incentives to spur household consumption. After winning reelection in October 2014 by a historically narrow margin, President Dilma ROUSSEFF appointed a new economic team led by Finance Minister Joaquim LEVY, who introduced a fiscal austerity package intended to restore the primary account surplus to 1.2% of GDP and preserve the country's investment-grade sovereign credit rating.  Brazil seeks to strengthen its workforce and its economy over the long run by imposing local content and technology transfer requirements on foreign businesses, by investing in education through social programs such as Bolsa Familia and the Brazil Science Mobility Program, and by investing in research in the areas of space, nanotechnology, healthcare, and energy."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$1.546 trillion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"13"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery, electrical and transport equipment, chemical products, oil, automotive parts, electronics"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"5.8%","industry":"23.8%","services":"70.4%","value":" (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$482.8 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"24"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"transport equipment, iron ore, soybeans, footwear, coffee, automobiles"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"0.8%","highest 10%":"42.9% (2009 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Pico da Neblina 2,994 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"10 00 S, 55 00 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"8,233 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"58.07  cu km/yr (28%/17%/55%)","per capita":"306  cu m/yr (2006)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"deforestation in Amazon Basin destroys the habitat and endangers a multitude of plant and animal species indigenous to the area;

Brazilian coffee exporters politically dominated the country until populist leader Getulio VARGAS rose to power in 1930. By far the largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil underwent more than a half century of populist and military government until 1985, when the military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian rulers. Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development of its interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor pool, it is today South America's largest economy and a regional leader.

After the importation of African slaves was outlawed in the mid-19th century, Brazil sought Europeans (Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards, and Germans) and later Asians (Japanese) to work in agriculture, especially coffee cultivation. Recent immigrants come mainly from Argentina, Chile, and Andean countries (many are unskilled illegal migrants) or are returning Brazilian nationals. Since Brazil's economic downturn in the 1980s, emigration to the United States, Europe, and Japan has been rising but is negligible relative to Brazil's total population. The majority of these emigrants are well-educated and middle-class.
