The country possesses substantial mineral, agricultural, and fishery resources, but it is still recovering from a civil war that destroyed most institutions before ending in the early 2000s. In recent years economic growth has been driven by mining - particularly iron ore. The countryâ€™s principal exports are iron ore, diamonds, and rutile, and the economy is vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices. In 2014, rapid spread of Ebolavirus caused a contraction of economic activity in several areas, including transportation, health, and industrial production. Iron ore production dropped, due to low global prices and high costs, driven by the epidemic. A long-term shutdown of the industry would badly hurt the economy because it supports thousands of jobs and creates about 20% of GDP. Until 2014, the government had relied on external assistance to support its budget, but it was gradually becoming more independent. The epidemic has disrupted economic activity, deterred private investment, and forced the government to increase expenditures on health care, straining the budget and restricting other public investment projects. A rise in international donor support will partially offset these fiscal constraints."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"foodstuffs, machinery and equipment, fuels and lubricants, chemicals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"42.5%","industry":"26.8%","services":"30.7% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$1.26 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"154"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"diamonds, rutile, cocoa, coffee, fish"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.6%","highest 10%":"33.6% (2003)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Loma Mansa (Bintimani) 1,948 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"8 30 N, 11 30 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"160 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.21  cu km/yr (52%/26%/22%)","per capita":"38.74  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Environmental Modification"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"rapid population growth pressuring the environment;

Originally the trade involved timber and ivory, but later it expanded into slaves. Following the American Revolution, a colony was established in 1787 and Sierra Leone became a destination for resettling black loyalists who had originally been resettled in Nova Scotia. After the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, British crews delivered thousands of Africans liberated from illegal slave ships to Sierra Leone, particularly Freetown. The colony gradually expanded inland during the course of the 19th century; independence was attained in 1961. Democracy is slowly being reestablished after the civil war (1991-2002) that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people (about one third of the population). The military, which took over full responsibility for security following the departure of UN peacekeepers at the end of 2005, is increasingly developing as a guarantor of the country's stability. The armed forces remained on the sideline during the 2007 and 2012 national elections, and deployed over 850 peacekeepers to the African Union Mission in Somalia. As of January 2014, Sierra Leone also fielded 122 staff for five UN peacekeeping missions. In March 2014, the closure of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone marked the end of more than 15 years of peacekeeping and political operations in Sierra Leone. The government's stated priorities include furthering development - including recovering from the Ebola epidemic - creating jobs, and stamping out endemic corruption."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"FREETOWN (capital) 1.007 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"41.93% (male 1,228,380/female 1,236,475)","15-24 years":"18.67% (male 532,738/female 564,828)","25-54 years":"31.85% (male 898,538/female 973,908)","55-64 years":"3.82% (male 102,915/female 121,864)","65 years and over":"3.73% (male 92,777/female 126,675) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"81.9%","youth dependency ratio":"77.1%","elderly dependency ratio":"4.9%","potential support ratio":"20.6% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"2,700 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"48"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.02 physicians/1,000 population (2010)"},"Languages":{"value":"English (official, regular use limited to literate minority), Mende (principal vernacular in the south), Temne (principal vernacular in the north), Krio (English-based Creole, spoken by the descendants of freed Jamaican slaves who were settled in the Freetown area, a lingua franca and a first language for 10% of the population but understood by 95%)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 86.7% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"16.6% (2013)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"54,000 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"54"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-2.77 migrant(s)/1,000 population","note":"refugees currently in surrounding countries are slowly returning (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"178"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 60%, Christian 10%, indigenous beliefs 30%"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"11.8% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"5"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 37.4% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"6.6% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"144"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Sierra Leonean(s)","adjective":"Sierra Leonean"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Temne 35%, Mende 31%, Limba 8%, Kono 5%, Kriole 2% (descendants of freed Jamaican slaves who were settled in the Freetown area in the late-18th century; also known as Krio), Mandingo 2%, Loko 2%, other 15% (includes refugees from Liberia's recent civil war, and small numbers of Europeans, Lebanese, Pakistanis, and Indians) (2008 census)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"0.4 beds/1,000 population (2006)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"0.99 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"0.94 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.92 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.85 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.73 male(s)/female","total population":"0.94 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"19 years","male":"18.4 years","female":"19.6 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"5,879,098 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"112"},"Birth rate":{"value":"37.03 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"14"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"2.9% of GDP (2012)","country comparison to the world":"141"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"18.1% (2013)","country comparison to the world":"34"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"573,287","percentage":"48% (2005 est.)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write English, Mende, Temne, or Arabic","total population":"48.1%","male":"58.7%","female":"37.7% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"4.8 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"19"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"1.4% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"36"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"57.79 years","male":"55.23 years","female":"60.42 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"204"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"71.68 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"80.14 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"62.96 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"11"},"Death rate":{"value":"10.81 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"35"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"39.9% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"2.75% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"2.35% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"32"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"malaria, dengue fever, and yellow fever","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","animal contact disease":"rabies","aerosolized dust or soil contact disease":"Lassa fever (2013)"}}}
