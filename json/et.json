Coffee is a major export crop. The agricultural sector suffers from poor cultivation practices and frequent drought, but recent joint efforts by the Government of Ethiopia and donors have strengthened Ethiopia's agricultural resilience, contributing to a reduction in the number of Ethiopians threatened with starvation. The banking, insurance, telecommunications, and micro-credit industries are restricted to domestic investors, but Ethiopia has attracted significant foreign investment in textiles, leather, commercial agriculture and manufacturing. Under Ethiopia's constitution, the state owns all land and provides long-term leases to the tenants; land use certificates are now being issued in some areas so that tenants have more recognizable rights to continued occupancy and hence make more concerted efforts to improve their leaseholds. While GDP growth has remained high, per capita income is among the lowest in the world. Ethiopia's economy continues on its state-led Growth and Transformation Plan and is scheduled to issue another development plan in 2015. Ethiopia has achieved high single-digit growth rates through government-led infrastructure expansion and commercial agriculture development.

Torn by bloody coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. A constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held in 1995. A border war with Eritrea in the late 1990s ended with a peace treaty in December 2000. In November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission (EEBC) issued specific coordinates as virtually demarcating the border and pronounced its work finished. Alleging that the EEBC acted beyond its mandate in issuing the coordinates, Ethiopia has not accepted them and has not withdrawn troops from previously contested areas pronounced by the EEBC as belonging to Eritrea. In August 2012, longtime leader Prime Minister MELES Zenawi died in office and was replaced by his Deputy Prime Minister HAILEMARIAM Desalegn, marking the first peaceful transition of power in decades."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"ADDIS ABABA (capital) 3.238 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"43.94% (male 21,900,571/female 21,809,643)","15-24 years":"19.98% (male 9,865,976/female 10,009,596)","25-54 years":"29.31% (male 14,487,280/female 14,667,179)","55-64 years":"3.88% (male 1,882,315/female 1,981,762)","65 years and over":"2.88% (male 1,289,336/female 1,572,161) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"81.6%","youth dependency ratio":"75.2%","elderly dependency ratio":"6.3%","potential support ratio":"15.8% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"23,400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"13"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.03 physicians/1,000 population (2009)"},"Languages":{"value":"Oromo (official working language in the State of Oromiya) 33.8%, Amharic (official national language) 29.3%, Somali (official working language of the State of Sumale) 6.2%, Tigrigna (Tigrinya) (official working language of the State of Tigray) 5.9%, Sidamo 4%, Wolaytta 2.2%, Gurage 2%, Afar (official working language of the State of Afar) 1.7%, Hadiyya 1.7%, Gamo 1.5%, Gedeo 1.3%, Opuuo 1.2%, Kafa 1.1%, other 8.1%, English (major foreign language taught in schools), Arabic (2007 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 72% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"28.6% (2010/11)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"730,300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"12"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-0.22 migrant(s)/1,000 population","note":"repatriation of Ethiopian refugees residing in Sudan is expected to continue for several years;
