Only a small amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel, substantial financial support from France - equal to more than 15% of GDP - and tourism are keys to the health of the economy; during 2009-10, France sent more development assistance to New Caledonia than to any of its other overseas territories. In October 2014, French Prime Minster Manuel VALLS confirmed financial support to New Caledonia totaling $500 million for the period 2016-20. Substantial new investment in the nickel industry — including two major new plants, combined with the recovery of global nickel prices, brightens the economic outlook for the next several years. In 2015 New Caledonia is likely to help fill China’s shortfall in nickel supplies left by an Indonesian ban on nickel ore exports. The new government, which inherited a $112 million deficit in 2013, is expected to focus on bringing the territory’s budget back into balance."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, fuels, chemicals, foodstuffs"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"1.4%","industry":"26.8%","services":"71.8% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$79 million (31 December 1998 est.)","country comparison to the world":"191"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"ferronickels, nickel ore, fish"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mont Panie 1,628 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"21 30 S, 165 30 E"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"erosion caused by mining exploitation and forest fires"},"Location":{"value":"Oceania, islands in the South Pacific Ocean, east of Australia"},"Geography - note":{"value":"consists of the main island of New Caledonia (one of the largest in the Pacific Ocean), the archipelago of Iles Loyaute, and numerous small, sparsely populated islands and atolls"},"Coastline":{"value":"2,254 km"},"Land boundaries":{"value":"0 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Oceania"},"Natural resources":{"value":"nickel, chrome, iron, cobalt, manganese, silver, gold, lead, copper"},"Terrain":{"value":"coastal plains with interior mountains"},"Area - comparative":{"value":"slightly smaller than New Jersey"},"Climate":{"value":"tropical;
