Slovakia joined the European Union (EU) in 2004 and the Eurozone in 2009.  The countryâ€™s banking sector is sound. Slovakia has led the region garnering FDI, because of its relatively low-cost, highly-skilled labor force, reasonable tax rates, and favorable geographic location in the heart of Central Europe.  However, recent increases in corporate taxes, as well as changes to the Labor Code, slow dispute resolution, and ongoing corruption potentially threaten the attractiveness of the Slovak market.

Subsequently, the Slovaks became part of the Hungarian Kingdom, where they remained for the next 1,000 years. Following the formation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867, language and education policies favoring the use of Hungarian (Magyarization) resulted in a strengthening of Slovak nationalism and a cultivation of cultural ties with the closely related Czechs, who were under Austrian rule. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close of World War I, the Slovaks joined the Czechs to form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar period, Slovak nationalist leaders pushed for autonomy within Czechoslovakia, and in 1939 Slovakia became an independent state allied with Nazi Germany. Following World War II, Czechoslovakia was reconstituted and came under communist rule within Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create \"socialism with a human face,\" ushering in a period of repression known as \"normalization.\" The peaceful \"Velvet Revolution\" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a nonviolent \"velvet divorce\" into its two national components, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Slovakia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 and the euro zone on 1 January 2009."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"BRATISLAVA (capital) 401,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"15.14% (male 422,297/female 402,154)","15-24 years":"11.78% (male 330,116/female 311,144)","25-54 years":"45.17% (male 1,241,594/female 1,217,885)","55-64 years":"13.56% (male 349,304/female 388,904)","65 years and over":"14.35% (male 299,097/female 482,532) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"40.8%","youth dependency ratio":"21.3%","elderly dependency ratio":"19.5%","potential support ratio":"5.1% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"less than 100 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"116"},"Physicians density":{"value":"3.32 physicians/1,000 population (2012)"},"Languages":{"value":"Slovak (official) 78.6%, Hungarian 9.4%, Roma 2.3%, Ruthenian 1%, other or unspecified 8.8% (2011 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 1.2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0.04 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"76"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 62%, Protestant 8.2%, Greek Catholic 3.8%, other or unspecified 12.5%, none 13.4% (2011 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"34%","male":"35%","female":"32.5% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"21"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"8.2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"62"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"27.4% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"54"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Slovak(s)","adjective":"Slovak"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Slovak 80.7%, Hungarian 8.5%, Roma 2%, other and unspecified 8.8% (2011 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"6 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.07 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.06 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.02 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.9 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.62 male(s)/female","total population":"0.94 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"39.6 years","male":"37.9 years","female":"41.4 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"5,445,027 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"118"},"Birth rate":{"value":"9.91 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"195"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"4.1% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"103"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"15 years","male":"14 years","female":"16 years (2012)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.39 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"212"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.02% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"129"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"76.88 years","male":"73.3 years","female":"80.71 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"77"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"5.27 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"5.91 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"4.58 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"175"},"Death rate":{"value":"9.74 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"49"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"53.6% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"-0.31% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.02% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"191"}}}
