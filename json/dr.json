The mining sector has also played a greater role in the export market since late 2012 with the commencement of the extraction phase of the Pueblo Viejo Gold and Silver mine. The economy is highly dependent upon the US, the destination for approximately half of exports. Remittances from the US amount to about 7% of GDP, equivalent to about a third of exports and two-thirds of tourism receipts. The country suffers from marked income inequality; the poorest half of the population receives less than one-fifth of GDP, while the richest 10% enjoys nearly 40% of GDP. High unemployment and underemployment remains an important long-term challenge. The Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into force in March 2007, boosting investment and exports and reducing losses to the Asian garment industry. The Dominican Republic's economy rebounded from the global recession in 2010-14, and the fiscal situation is improving. A tax reform package passed in November 2012 and a reduction in government spending helped to narrow the central government budget deficit from 6.6% of GDP in 2012 to 2.7% in 2014. A successful government bond placement in 2013 and 2014 helped finance the deficit. A liability management operation in January 2015, in which the government paid down over $4 billion of the country’s Petrocaribe debt, at a discount of 52% with proceeds from the sale of $2.5 billion in global bonds, reduced the country’s debt load by approximately by 3.3% of GDP."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum, foodstuffs, cotton and fabrics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"6.3%","industry":"32.1%","services":"61.6% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$18.78 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"84"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"gold, silver, cocoa, sugar, coffee, tobacco, meats, consumer goods"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"1.9%","highest 10%":"35.8% (2012 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Lago Enriquillo -46 m","highest point":"Pico Duarte 3,175 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"19 00 N, 70 40 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"21 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"5.47  cu km/yr (26%/1%/72%)","per capita":"574.2  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"water shortages;

Christopher COLUMBUS explored and claimed the island on his first voyage in 1492; it became a springboard for Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain recognized French dominion over the western third of the island, which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of the island, by then known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence in 1821 but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire, but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865. A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed, capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930 to 1961. Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963. In 1965, the US led an intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in the presidential election. BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996. Since then, regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition candidates have won the presidency. Former President Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna (first term 1996-2000) won election to a new term in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve more than one term, and was later reelected to a second consecutive term. In 2012, Danilo MEDINA Sanchez was elected president."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"SANTO DOMINGO (capital) 2.945 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"27.53% (male 1,467,374/female 1,416,998)","15-24 years":"18.39% (male 982,191/female 945,087)","25-54 years":"39.41% (male 2,113,028/female 2,016,733)","55-64 years":"7.44% (male 392,230/female 387,052)","65 years and over":"7.23% (male 349,983/female 408,080) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"57.8%","youth dependency ratio":"47.3%","elderly dependency ratio":"10.5%","potential support ratio":"9.5% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"3,100 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"44"},"Physicians density":{"value":"1.49 physicians/1,000 population (2011)"},"Languages":{"value":"Spanish (official)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 16% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"73% (2009/10)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"69,300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"52"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-1.91 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"164"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 95%, other 5%"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"29.4%","male":"22.6%","female":"40.8% (2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"26"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"5.4% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"130"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 15.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"23% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"90"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Dominican(s)","adjective":"Dominican"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"mixed 73%, white 16%, black 11%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"1.7 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.04 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.86 male(s)/female","total population":"1.03 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"27.4 years","male":"27.2 years","female":"27.6 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"10,478,756 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"87"},"Birth rate":{"value":"18.73 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"93"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"3.8% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"163"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"4% (2013)","country comparison to the world":"106"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"180,423","percentage":"10% (2000 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"13 years","male":"13 years","female":"14 years (2012)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"91.8%","male":"91.2%","female":"92.3% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.33 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"89"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"1.04% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"45"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"77.97 years","male":"75.76 years","female":"80.28 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"63"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"18.84 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"20.75 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"16.86 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"94"},"Death rate":{"value":"4.55 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"201"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"79% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"2.6% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.23% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"96"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne disease":"dengue fever (2013)"}}}
