The development of oil and gas resources in offshore waters has greatly supplemented government revenues. This technology-intensive industry, however, has done little to create jobs in part because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste. Gas is currently piped to Australia for processing, but Timor-Leste has expressed interest in developing a domestic processing capacity. In June 2005, the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste's petroleum wealth for future generations. The Fund held assets of $16.5 billion, as of December 2014. Oil accounts for 90% of government revenues, and the drop in the price of oil in 2014 has led to concerns about the long-term sustainability of government spending. The Ministry of Finance maintains that the Petroleum Fund is sufficient to sustain government operations for the foreseeable future. Annual government budget expenditures increased markedly between 2009 and 2012 but dropped significantly in 2013 and again in 2014. Historically, the government has failed to spend as much as its budget allowed. The government has focused significant resources on basic infrastructure, including electricity and roads. Limited experience in procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects. The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and to reduce poverty."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"food, gasoline, kerosene, machinery"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"5.2%","industry":"72.8%","services":"22.1% (2014 est.)"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"oil, coffee, sandalwood, marble","note":"potential for vanilla exports"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"4%","highest 10%":"27% (2007)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Timor Sea, Savu Sea, and Banda Sea 0 m","highest point":"Foho Tatamailau 2,963 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"8 50 S, 125 55 E"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"widespread use of slash and burn agriculture has led to deforestation and soil erosion"},"Location":{"value":"Southeastern Asia, northwest of Australia in the Lesser Sunda Islands at the eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago;

The ISF and UNMIT restored stability, allowing for presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. In February 2008, a rebel group staged an unsuccessful attack against the president and prime minister. The ringleader was killed in the attack, and most of the rebels surrendered in April 2008. Since the attack, the government has enjoyed one of its longest periods of post-independence stability, including successful 2012 elections for both the parliament and president.
