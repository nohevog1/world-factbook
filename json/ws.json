It has a nominal GDP of $780 million.  Agriculture, including fishing, employs roughly two-thirds of the labor force and furnishes 90% of exports, featuring fish, coconut oil, nonu products, and taro. The manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. One factory in the Foreign Trade Zone employs 1,000 people to make automobile electrical harnesses for an assembly plant in Australia, and is responsible for 65% of total exports.  Industry accounts for nearly 15% of GDP while employing less than 6% of the work force.  The service sector accounts for nearly three-quarters of GDP and employs approximately 50% of the labor force. Tourism is an expanding sector accounting for 25% of GDP; 132,000 tourists visited the islands in 2013. The country is vulnerable to devastating storms. In late September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting tsunami severely damaged Samoa, and nearby American Samoa, disrupting transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths. In December 2012, extensive flooding and wind damage from Tropical Cyclone Evan killed four people, displaced over 6,000, and damaged or destroyed an estimated 1,500 homes in Samoa's Upolu Island. The Samoan Government has called for deregulation of the financial sector, encouragement of investment, and continued fiscal discipline, while at the same time protecting the environment. Foreign reserves are in a relatively healthy state and inflation is low, but the external debt is approximately 55% of GDP. Samoa became the 155th member of the WTO in May 2012, and graduated from least developed country (LDC) status in January 2014."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, industrial supplies, foodstuffs"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"11.4%","industry":"30.1%","services":"58.5% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$422.9 million (31 December 2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"182"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"fish, coconut oil and cream, nonu, copra, taro, automotive parts, garments, beer"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Pacific Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mount Silisili 1,857 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"13 35 S, 172 20 W"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"soil erosion, deforestation, invasive species, overfishing"},"Location":{"value":"Oceania, group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean, about halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand"},"Geography - note":{"value":"occupies an almost central position within Polynesia"},"Coastline":{"value":"403 km"},"Land boundaries":{"value":"0 km"},"Map references":{"value":"Oceania"},"Natural resources":{"value":"hardwood forests, fish, hydropower"},"Terrain":{"value":"two main islands (Savaii, Upolu) and several smaller islands and uninhabited islets;
