Although GDP grew only slightly during the past decade, Curacao enjoys a high per capita income and a well-developed infrastructure compared with other countries in the region. Curacao has an excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil tankers, and the Port of Willemstad hosts a free trade zone and a dry dock. Venezuelan state oil company PdVSA, under a contract in effect until 2019, leases the single refinery on the island from the government, directly employing some 1,000 people; most of the oil for the refinery is imported from Venezuela; most of the refined products are exported to the US and Asia. Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported, with the US, the Netherlands and Venezuela being the major suppliers. The government is attempting to diversify its industry and trade and has signed an Association Agreement with the EU to expand business there. Most of Curacaoâ€™s GDP results from services. Curacao has limited natural resources, poor soil, and inadequate water supplies, and budgetary problems complicate reform of the health and education systems. In 2013, the government implemented changes to the sales tax and reformed the public pension and health care systems, including increasing the sales tax from 5% to as high as 9% on some products, raising the age for public pension withdrawals to 65, and requiring citizens to pay higher premiums."},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"crude petroleum, food, manufactures"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"0.7%","industry":"15.5%","services":"83.8% (2012 est.)"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum products"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Mt.

Once the center of the Caribbean slave trade, Curacao was hard hit economically by the abolition of slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early 20th century with the construction of the Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered Venezuelan oil fields. In 1954, Curacao and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles, part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In referenda in 2005 and 2009, the citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The change in status became effective in October 2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"WILLEMSTED (capital) 145,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"20.3% (male 15,334/female 14,739)","15-24 years":"14.7% (male 11,356/female 10,448)","25-54 years":"37.6% (male 27,125/female 28,716)","55-64 years":"13.2% (male 8,545/female 11,150)","65 years and over":"14.2% (male 8,698/female 12,340) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"51.1%","youth dependency ratio":"28.7%","elderly dependency ratio":"22.4%","potential support ratio":"4.5% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Languages":{"value":"Papiamentu (a Spanish-Portuguese-Dutch-English dialect) 81.2%, Dutch (official) 8%, Spanish 4%, English 2.9%, other 3.9% (2001 census)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-1.4 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"59"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 72.8%, Pentecostal 6.6%, Protestant 3.2%, Adventist 3%, Jehovah's Witness 2%, Evangelical 1.9%, other 3.8%, none 6%, unspecified 0.6% (2011 est.)"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Curacaoan","adjective":"Curacaoan; Dutch"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Afro-Caribbean majority; Dutch, French, Latin American, East Asian, South Asian, Jewish minorities"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.09 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.94 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.77 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.7 male(s)/female","total population":"0.92 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"36.1 years","male":"33 years","female":"39.9 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"148,406 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"189"},"Birth rate":{"value":"NA 13.8 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.07 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"107"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"78.2 years","male":"75.9 years","female":"80.6 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"62"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"7.9 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"8.5 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"7.3 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)"},"Death rate":{"value":"8.2 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"98"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"89.3% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"2.04% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.43% (2015 est.)"}}}
