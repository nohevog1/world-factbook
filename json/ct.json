The agricultural sector generates more than half of GDP. Timber and diamonds account for most export earnings, followed by cotton. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. Factional fighting between the government and its opponents remains a drag on economic revitalization. Since 2009 the IMF has worked closely with the government to institute reforms that have resulted in some improvement in budget transparency, but other problems remain. The government's additional spending in the run-up to the election in 2011 worsened CAR's fiscal situation. Distribution of income is extraordinarily unequal. Grants from France and the international community can only partially meet humanitarian needs. In 2012, the World Bank approved $125 million in funding for transport infrastructure and regional trade, focused on the route between CAR's capital and the port of Douala in Cameroon. After a two-year lag in donor support, the IMF's first review of CAR's extended credit facility for 2012-15 praised improvements in revenue collection but warned of weak management of spending."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"food, textiles, petroleum products, machinery, electrical equipment, motor vehicles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"55.1%","industry":"12.5%","services":"32.3% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$543.3 million (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"175"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"diamonds, timber, cotton, coffee"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.1%","highest 10%":"33% (2003)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Oubangui River 335 m","highest point":"Mont Ngaoui 1,420 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"7 00 N, 21 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"144.4 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.07  cu km/yr (83%/17%/1%)","per capita":"17.42  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Law of the Sea"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"tap water is not potable;

After three tumultuous decades of misrule - mostly by military governments - civilian rule was established in 1993 but lasted only a decade. In March, 2003 President Ange-Felix PATASSE was deposed in a military coup led by General Francois BOZIZE, who established a transitional government. Elections held in 2005 affirmed General BOZIZE as president; he was reelected in 2011 in voting widely viewed as flawed. The government still lacks full control of the countryside, where pockets of lawlessness persist. The militant group, Lord's Resistance Army, continues to destabilize southeastern Central African Republic, and several rebel groups joined together in early December 2012 to launch a series of attacks that left them in control of numerous towns in the northern and central parts of the country. The rebels - unhappy with BOZIZE's government - participated in peace talks in early January 2013 which resulted in a coalition government including the rebellion's leadership. In March 2013, the coalition government dissolved, rebels seized the capital, and President BOZIZE fled the country. Rebel leader Michel DJOTODIA assumed the presidency and the following month established a National Transitional Council (CNT). In January 2014, the CNT elected Catherine SAMBA-PANZA as interim president; new general elections, originally scheduled for October 2015, have now been postponed to at least 2016."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"BANGUI (capital) 794,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"40.43% (male 1,095,968/female 1,083,705)","15-24 years":"20.06% (male 543,491/female 537,804)","25-54 years":"32.02% (male 863,314/female 862,916)","55-64 years":"3.98% (male 96,377/female 118,278)","65 years and over":"3.52% (male 74,192/female 115,494) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"75.2%","youth dependency ratio":"68.4%","elderly dependency ratio":"6.8%","potential support ratio":"14.8% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"9,900 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"24"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.05 physicians/1,000 population (2009)"},"Languages":{"value":"French (official), Sangho (lingua franca and national language), tribal languages"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 78.2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"15.2% (2010/11)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"135,400 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"34"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"102"},"Religions":{"value":"indigenous beliefs 35%, Protestant 25%, Roman Catholic 25%, Muslim 15%","note":"animistic beliefs and practices strongly influence the Christian majority"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"3.9% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"168"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 31.5% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"4.4% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"175"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Central African(s)","adjective":"Central African"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Baya 33%, Banda 27%, Mandjia 13%, Sara 10%, Mboum 7%, M'Baka 4%, Yakoma 4%, other 2%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"1 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.03 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.82 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.64 male(s)/female","total population":"0.98 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"19.5 years","male":"19.2 years","female":"19.9 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"5,391,539","note":"estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"119"},"Birth rate":{"value":"35.08 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"22"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"1.2% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"171"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"23.5% (2011)","country comparison to the world":"26"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"532,518","percentage":"47% (2006 est.)"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"7 years","male":"9 years","female":"6 years (2012)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"36.8%","male":"50.7%","female":"24.4% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"4.41 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"31"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"4.25% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"15"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"51.81 years","male":"50.5 years","female":"53.16 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"219"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"90.63 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"98.24 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"82.79 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"4"},"Death rate":{"value":"13.8 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"10"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"40% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"2.59% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"2.13% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"45"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"very high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A and E, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"malaria and dengue fever","respiratory disease":"meningococcal meningitis","water contact disease":"schistosomiasis","animal contact disease":"rabies (2013)"}}}
