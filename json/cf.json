Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports. Natural gas is increasingly being converted to electricity rather than being flared, greatly improving energy prospects. New mining projects, particularly iron ore, which entered production in late 2013 may add as much as $1 billion to annual government revenue. Economic reform efforts have been undertaken with the support of international organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF, including recently concluded Article IV consultations. The current administration faces difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty. The recent drop in oil prices has constrained government spending; lower oil prices forced the government to cut more than $1 billion in planned spending. Officially the country became a net external creditor as of 2011, with external debt representing only about 16% of GDP and debt servicing less than 3% of government revenue."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"capital equipment, construction materials, foodstuffs"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"3.3%","industry":"74.4%","services":"22.3% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$3.561 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"132"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"petroleum, lumber, plywood, sugar, cocoa, coffee, diamonds"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.1%","highest 10%":"37.1% (2005)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Atlantic Ocean 0 m","highest point":"Mount Berongou 903 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"1 00 S, 15 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"832 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"0.05  cu km/yr (69%/26%/4%)","per capita":"13.99  cu m/yr (2005)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"none of the selected agreements"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"air pollution from vehicle emissions;
