The current account balance has recorded consecutive surpluses since 2003, international reserves remain at comfortable levels, and the banking system is stable; the stock market resumed an upward trajectory in 2014, climbing to new record highs during the first four months of 2015. Efforts to improve tax administration and management of expenditures have helped ease the Philippines' tight fiscal situation and reduce debt levels. Nevertheless, government taxation and spending remain weak. The Philippines has received investment-grade credit ratings on its sovereign debt under the AQUINO administration and has had little difficulty financing its deficits. Economic growth has accelerated, averaging 6.0% per year from 2011-2014, compared with 4.5% under the MACAPAGAL-ARROYO government; competitiveness has improved; and foreign direct investment hit a historic high in 2014, although it continues to lag compared with the rest of the region. Unemployment has remained high, hovering at around 7% of the population, and underemployment is nearly 20%. At least 40% of the employed work in the informal sector and poverty afflicts about a quarter of the population. The AQUINO administration has been working to boost expenditures for education, health, transfers to the poor, and other social spending programs. Infrastructure remains underfunded and the government is relying on the private sector to help with major projects under its Public-Private Partnership program. Other long term challenges include reforming governance, the judicial system, and the regulatory environment, and improving the ease of doing business. The Philippine Constitution and other laws restrict foreign ownership in important activities/sectors - such as land ownership and public utilities.

they were ceded to the US in 1898 following the Spanish-American War. In 1935 the Philippines became a self-governing commonwealth. Manuel QUEZON was elected president and was tasked with preparing the country for independence after a 10-year transition. In 1942 the islands fell under Japanese occupation during World War II, and US forces and Filipinos fought together during 1944-45 to regain control. On 4 July 1946 the Republic of the Philippines attained its independence. A 20-year rule by Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986, when a \"people power\" movement in Manila (\"EDSA 1\") forced him into exile and installed Corazon AQUINO as president. Her presidency was hampered by several coup attempts that prevented a return to full political stability and economic development. Fidel RAMOS was elected president in 1992. His administration was marked by increased stability and by progress on economic reforms. In 1992, the US closed its last military bases on the islands. Joseph ESTRADA was elected president in 1998. He was succeeded by his vice-president, Gloria MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, in January 2001 after ESTRADA's stormy impeachment trial on corruption charges broke down and another \"people power\" movement (\"EDSA 2\") demanded his resignation. MACAPAGAL-ARROYO was elected to a six-year term as president in May 2004. Her presidency was marred by several corruption allegations but the Philippine economy was one of the few to avoid contraction following the 2008 global financial crisis, expanding each year of her administration. Benigno AQUINO III was elected to a six-year term as president in May 2010. The Philippine Government faces threats from several groups, some of which are on the US Government's Foreign Terrorist Organization list. Manila has waged a decades-long struggle against ethnic Moro insurgencies in the southern Philippines, which has led to a peace accord with the Moro National Liberation Front and ongoing peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. The decades-long Maoist-inspired New People's Army insurgency also operates through much of the country. The Philippines faces increased tension with China over disputed territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"MANILA (capital) 12.946 million; Davao 1.63 million; Cebu City 951,000; Zamboanga 936,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"34.02% (male 17,531,370/female 16,828,067)","15-24 years":"19.18% (male 9,891,032/female 9,484,089)","25-54 years":"36.72% (male 18,810,887/female 18,273,641)","55-64 years":"5.8% (male 2,673,756/female 3,183,809)","65 years and over":"4.28% (male 1,802,632/female 2,519,093) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"57.6%","youth dependency ratio":"50.3%","elderly dependency ratio":"7.2%","potential support ratio":"13.9% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"500 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"83"},"Languages":{"value":"Filipino (official; based on Tagalog) and English (official); eight major dialects - Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon or Ilonggo, Bicol, Waray, Pampango, and Pangasinan"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 26.1% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"48.9% (2011)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"35,600 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"64"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-2.09 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"169"},"Religions":{"value":"Catholic 82.9% (Roman Catholic 80.9%, Aglipayan 2%), Muslim 5%, Evangelical 2.8%, Iglesia ni Kristo 2.3%, other Christian 4.5%, other 1.8%, unspecified 0.6%, none 0.1% (2000 census)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"16.3%","male":"15.2%","female":"18.3% (2011 est.)","country comparison to the world":"74"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"4.4% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"150"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 8.2% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"4.7% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"148"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Filipino(s)","adjective":"Philippine"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Tagalog 28.1%, Cebuano 13.1%, Ilocano 9%, Bisaya/Binisaya 7.6%, Hiligaynon Ilonggo 7.5%, Bikol 6%, Waray 3.4%, other 25.3% (2000 census)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"1 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.03 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.84 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.72 male(s)/female","total population":"1.01 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"23.2 years","male":"22.8 years","female":"23.7 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"100,998,376 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"13"},"Birth rate":{"value":"24.27 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"59"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"2.7% of GDP (2009)","country comparison to the world":"149"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"20.2% (2011)","country comparison to the world":"29"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"11 years","male":"11 years","female":"11 years (2009)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"96.3%","male":"95.8%","female":"96.8% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"3.09 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"53"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.06% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"118"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"68.96 years","male":"65.47 years","female":"72.62 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"160"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"22.34 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"25.27 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"19.27 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"80"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.11 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"160"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"44.4% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"1.32% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.61% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"74"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"dengue fever and malaria","water contact disease":"leptospirosis (2013)"}}}
