Captain William KEELING discovered the islands in 1609, but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century. From the 1820s to 1978, members of the CLUNIE-ROSS family controlled the islands and the copra produced from local coconuts. Annexed by the UK in 1857, the Cocos Islands were transferred to the Australian Government in 1955. Apart from North Keeling Island, which lies 30 kilometers north of the main group, the islands form a horseshoe-shaped atoll surrounding a lagoon. North Keeling Island was declared a national park in 1995 and is administered by Parks Australia. The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic Europeans on West Island and the ethnic Malays on Home Island."}},"People and Society":{"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Languages":{"value":"Malay (Cocos dialect), English"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Religions":{"value":"Sunni Muslim 80%, other 20% (2002 est.)"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Cocos Islander(s)","adjective":"Cocos Islander"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Europeans, Cocos Malays"},"Population":{"value":"596 (July 2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"237"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"NA"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"NA","male":"NA","female":"NA"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"NA","male":"NA","female":"NA"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"197"}}}
