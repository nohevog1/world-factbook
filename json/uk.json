At its zenith in the 19th century, the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth, the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process, but devolution was fully completed in March 2010."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"LONDON (capital) 10.313 million; Manchester 2.646 million; Birmingham 2.515 million; Glasgow 1.223 million; Southampton/Portsmouth 882,000; Liverpool 870,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"17.37% (male 5,706,871/female 5,424,654)","15-24 years":"12.41% (male 4,060,480/female 3,891,262)","25-54 years":"40.91% (male 13,344,087/female 12,873,234)","55-64 years":"11.58% (male 3,675,565/female 3,746,483)","65 years and over":"17.73% (male 5,086,919/female 6,278,667) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"55.1%","youth dependency ratio":"27.6%","elderly dependency ratio":"27.6%","potential support ratio":"3.6% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"fewer than 600 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"82"},"Physicians density":{"value":"2.81 physicians/1,000 population (2013)"},"Languages":{"value":"English","note":"the following are recognized regional languages: Scots (about 30% of the population of Scotland), Scottish Gaelic (about 60,000 in Scotland), Welsh (about 20% of the population of Wales), Irish (about 10% of the population of Northern Ireland), Cornish (some 2,000 to 3,000 in Cornwall) (2012 est.)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0.8% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"84%","note":"percent of women aged 16-49 (2008/09)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"126,700 (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"36"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"2.54 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"40"},"Religions":{"value":"Christian (includes Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist) 59.5%, Muslim 4.4%, Hindu 1.3%, other 2%, unspecified 7.2%, none 25.7% (2011 est.)"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"21%","male":"23.8%","female":"17.9% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"52"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"9.1% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"30"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"29.8% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"43"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Briton(s), British (collective plural)","adjective":"British"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"white 87.2%, black/African/Caribbean/black British 3%, Asian/Asian British: Indian 2.3%, Asian/Asian British: Pakistani 1.9%, mixed 2%, other 3.7% (2011 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"2.9 beds/1,000 population (2011)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.98 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.81 male(s)/female","total population":"0.99 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"40.4 years","male":"39.2 years","female":"41.6 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"64,088,222 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"23"},"Birth rate":{"value":"12.17 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"161"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"6% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"36"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"16 years","male":"16 years","female":"17 years (2012)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.89 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"140"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.33% (2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"81"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"80.54 years","male":"78.37 years","female":"82.83 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"33"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"4.38 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"4.8 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"3.95 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"187"},"Death rate":{"value":"9.35 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"60"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"82.6% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"0.88% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.54% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"155"}}}
