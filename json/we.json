Following World War I, the Allied powers (France, UK, Russia) allocated the area to the British Mandate of Palestine. After World War II, the UN passed a resolution to establish two states within the Mandate, and designated a territory including what is now known as the West Bank as part of the proposed Arab state. Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the area was captured by Transjordan (later renamed Jordan). Jordan annexed the West Bank in 1950. In June 1967, Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War. With the exception of East Jerusalem and the former Israeli-Jordanian border zone, the West Bank remained under Israeli military control until Israel transferred security and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority (PA) under a series of agreements signed between 1994 and 1999. Negotiations to determine the permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip stalled after the outbreak of an intifada in mid-2000. In early 2003, the \"Quartet\" of the US, EU, UN, and Russia, presented a roadmap to a final peace settlement by 2005, calling for two states - Israel and a democratic Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late 2004 and the subsequent election of Mahmud ABBAS (head of the Fatah political faction) as PA president, Israel and the Palestinians agreed to move the peace process forward. Israel in late 2005 unilaterally withdrew all of its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and redeployed its military from several West Bank settlements but continues to control maritime, airspace, and other access. In early 2006, the Islamic Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won the Palestinian Legislative Council election and took control of the PA government. Attempts to form a unity government failed, and violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters ensued, culminating in HAMAS's violent seizure of all military and governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. Fatah and HAMAS have made several attempts at reconciliation, most recently signing an agreement in April 2014 following the collapse of US-brokered peace talks with Israel. The factions, however, have been unable to implement details on governance and security, and the status quo remains with HAMAS in de facto control of the Gaza Strip and the PA governing the West Bank."}},"People and Society":{"Nationality":{"noun":"NA","adjective":"NA"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Palestinian Arab and other 83%, Jewish 17%"},"Languages":{"value":"Arabic, Hebrew (spoken by Israeli settlers and many Palestinians), English (widely understood)"},"Religions":{"value":"Muslim 80.0 - 85.0% (predominantly Sunni), Jewish 12.0 - 14.0%, Christian 1.0 - 2.5% (mainly Greek Orthodox), other, unaffiliated, unspecified \nnote: the proportion of Christians continues to fall mainly as a result of the growth of the Muslim population but also because of the migration and the declining birth rate of the Christian population (2012 est.)\nreligious affiliation:\n \n          \nPopulation:\n2,785,366 (represents Palestinian population only) (July 2014 est.)\nnote: approximately 356,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank; approximately 200,000 Israeli settlers live in East Jerusalem (2013) (July 2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  142\nAge structure:\n0-14 years: 33.09% (male 473,108/female 448,612)\n15-24 years: 21.52% (male 307,020/female 292,465)\n25-54 years: 36.96% (male 529,094/female 500,375)\n55-64 years: 4.57% (male 64,093/female 63,289)\n65 years and over: 3.85% (male 45,303/female 62,007) (2015 est.)\npopulation pyramid:\n \n          \nDependency ratios:\ntotal dependency ratio: 76%\nyouth dependency ratio: 70.8%\nelderly dependency ratio: 5.2%\npotential support ratio: 19.2%\nnote: data represents the Gaza and the West Bank (2015 est.)\nMedian age:\ntotal: 22.7 years\nmale: 22.6 years\nfemale: 22.9 years (2015 est.)\nPopulation growth rate:\n1.95% (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  51\nBirth rate:\n22.99 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  67\nDeath rate:\n3.5 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  216\nNet migration rate:\n0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  111\nUrbanization:\nurban population: 75.3% of total population (2015)\nrate of urbanization: 2.81% annual rate of change (2005-10 est.)\nnote: data represents Gaza Strip and West Bank\nSex ratio:\nat birth: 1.06 male(s)/female\n0-14 years: 1.06 male(s)/female\n15-24 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n25-54 years: 1.06 male(s)/female\n55-64 years: 1.01 male(s)/female\n65 years and over: 0.73 male(s)/female\ntotal population: 1.04 male(s)/female (2015 est.)\nInfant mortality rate:\ntotal: 13.08 deaths/1,000 live births\nmale: 14.7 deaths/1,000 live births\nfemale: 11.37 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  115\nLife expectancy at birth:\ntotal population: 75.91 years\nmale: 73.79 years\nfemale: 78.17 years (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  92\nTotal fertility rate:\n2.76 children born/woman (2015 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  66\nContraceptive prevalence rate:\n52.5% (includes Gaza Strip and the West Bank) (2010)\nPhysicians density:\n1.3 physicians/1,000 population (2013)\nHospital bed density:\n1.2 beds/1,000 population (2010)\nDrinking water source:\nimproved: \nurban: 50.7% of population\nrural: 81.5% of population\ntotal: 58.4% of population\nunimproved: \nurban: 49.3% of population\nrural: 18.5% of population\ntotal: 41.6% of population\n\nnote: includes Gaza and the West Bank (2015 est.)\nSanitation facility access:\nimproved: \nurban: 93% of population\nrural: 90.2% of population\ntotal: 92.3% of population\nunimproved: \nurban: 7% of population\nrural: 9.8% of population\ntotal: 7.7% of population\n\nnote: includes Gaza and the West Bank (2015 est.)\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate:\nNA\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS:\nNA\nHIV/AIDS - deaths:\nNA\nLiteracy:\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 96.5%\nmale: 98.4%\nfemale: 94.5%\nnotes: estimates are for the Palestinian Territories (2015 est.)\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education):\ntotal: 13 years\nmale: 12 years\nfemale: 14 years\nnote: data represents Gaza and West Bank (2013)\nUnemployment, youth ages 15-24:\ntotal: 38.8%\nmale: 34.5%\nfemale: 62.2%\nnote: includes Gaza Strip (2012 est.)\ncountry comparison to the world:  15\n"}}}
