The down-turn coincided with the phase-out of tax preferences that had led US firms to invest heavily in the Commonwealth since the 1950s, and a steep rise in the price of oil, which generates most of the island's electricity. Diminished job opportunities prompted a sharp rise in outmigration, as many Puerto Ricans sought jobs on the US mainland. Unemployment reached 16% in 2011, but declined to 13.7% in December 2014. US minimum wage laws apply in Puerto Rico, hampering job expansion. Per capita income is about half that of the US mainland. The industrial sector greatly exceeds agriculture as the locus of economic activity and income. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of income with estimated arrivals of more than 3.6 million tourists in 2008. Puerto Rico's merchandise trade surplus is exceptionally strong, with exports nearly 50% greater than imports, and its current account surplus amounts to about 10% of GDP. Closing the budget deficit while restoring economic growth and employment remain the central concerns of the government. The gap between revenues and expenditures narrowed to 0.2% of GDP in 2014, although analysts believe that not all expenditures have been accounted for in the budget and a better accounting of costs would yield an overall deficit of roughly 5% of GDP in 2014. Public debt rose to nearly 94% of GDP in 2014, the equivalent of $15,600 per person, or nearly three times the per capita debt of the State of Connecticut, the highest in the US. Much of that debt was issued by state-run schools and public corporations, including water and electric utilities. In June 2015, Governor Alejandro GARCIA Padilla announced that the island could not pay back at least $73 billion in debt and that it would seek a deal with its creditors."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"chemicals, machinery and equipment, clothing, food, fish, petroleum products"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"0.7%","industry":"48.5%","services":"50.8% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$52.98 billion (31 December 2009 est.)","country comparison to the world":"59"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"chemicals, electronics, apparel, canned tuna, rum, beverage concentrates, medical equipment"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"NA%","highest 10%":"NA%"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Cerro de Punta 1,338 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"18 15 N, 66 30 W"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"erosion;

In 1898, after 400 years of colonial rule that saw the indigenous population nearly exterminated and African slave labor introduced, Puerto Rico was ceded to the US as a result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917. Popularly elected governors have served since 1948. In 1952, a constitution was enacted providing for internal self government. In plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998, voters chose not to alter the existing political status with the US, but the results of a 2012 vote left open the possibility of American statehood. Economic recession on the island has led to a net population loss since about 2005, as large numbers of residents moved to the US mainland. The trend has accelerated since 2010; in 2014, Puerto Rico experienced a net population loss to the mainland of 64,000, more than double the net loss of 26,000 in 2010."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"SAN JUAN (capital) 2.463 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"17.72% (male 325,944/female 311,520)","15-24 years":"14.3% (male 263,337/female 251,215)","25-54 years":"38.39% (male 661,124/female 720,160)","55-64 years":"12.1% (male 197,073/female 238,351)","65 years and over":"17.5% (male 271,633/female 358,000) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"50%","youth dependency ratio":"28.3%","elderly dependency ratio":"21.7%","potential support ratio":"4.6% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Languages":{"value":"Spanish, English"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0.7% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-8.15 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"208"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic 85%, Protestant and other 15%"},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"26.6%","male":"28.9%","female":"23.1% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"33"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 6.4% of population (2001 est.)","unimproved":""},"Nationality":{"noun":"Puerto Rican(s) (US citizens)","adjective":"Puerto Rican"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"white 75.8%, black/African American 12.4%, other 8.5% (includes American Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, other Pacific Islander, and others), mixed 3.3%","note":"99% of the population is Latino (2010 est.)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.02 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.92 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.83 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.76 male(s)/female","total population":"0.92 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"39.1 years","male":"37.1 years","female":"41 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"3,598,357 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"131"},"Birth rate":{"value":"10.86 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"180"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"NA"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"15 years","male":"14 years","female":"15 years (2013)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"93.3%","male":"92.8%","female":"93.8% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"1.64 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"176"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"79.25 years","male":"75.62 years","female":"82.94 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"48"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"7.57 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"8.38 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"6.75 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"157"},"Death rate":{"value":"8.67 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"73"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"93.6% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"-0.21% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"-0.6% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"227"}}}
