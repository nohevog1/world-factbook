Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE. Reelected in May 2006, QARASE was ousted in a December 2006 military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who initially appointed himself acting president but in January 2007 became interim prime minister. Following years of political turmoil, long-delayed legislative elections were held in September 2014 that were deemed \"credible\" by international observers and that resulted in BAINIMARAMA being reelected."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"SUVA (capital) 176,000 (2014)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"28.03% (male 130,251/female 124,633)","15-24 years":"16.73% (male 77,716/female 74,449)","25-54 years":"41.12% (male 191,393/female 182,571)","55-64 years":"8.04% (male 37,019/female 36,141)","65 years and over":"6.07% (male 25,386/female 29,830) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"52.8%","youth dependency ratio":"43.9%","elderly dependency ratio":"8.9%","potential support ratio":"11.2% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"fewer than 100 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"120"},"Physicians density":{"value":"0.43 physicians/1,000 population (2009)"},"Languages":{"value":"English (official), Fijian (official), Hindustani"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 8.9% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"700 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"122"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-6.75 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"203"},"Religions":{"value":"Protestant 45% (Methodist 34.6%, Assembly of God 5.7%, Seventh Day Adventist 3.9%, and Anglican 0.8%), Hindu 27.9%, other Christian 10.4%, Roman Catholic 9.1%, Muslim 6.3%, Sikh 0.3%, other 0.3%, none 0.8% (2007 est.)"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"4.1% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"160"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 4.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"35.9% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"25"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Fijian(s)","adjective":"Fijian"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"iTaukei 56.8% (predominantly Melanesian with a Polynesian admixture), Indian 37.5%, Rotuman 1.2%, other 4.5% (European, part European, other Pacific Islanders, Chinese)","note":"a 2010 law replaces 'Fijian' with 'iTuakei' when referring to the original and native settlers of Fiji (2007 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"2 beds/1,000 population (2009)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.04 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"1.02 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.85 male(s)/female","total population":"1.03 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"28.2 years","male":"28 years","female":"28.4 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"909,389 (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"162"},"Birth rate":{"value":"19.43 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"88"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"4.2% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"102"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.47 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"81"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"0.13% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"109"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"72.43 years","male":"69.79 years","female":"75.2 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"141"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"9.94 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"10.97 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"8.87 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"138"},"Death rate":{"value":"6.04 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"163"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"53.7% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"1.45% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"0.67% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"149"}}}
