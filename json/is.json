Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, and pharmaceuticals are among the leading exports. Its major imports include crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Israel usually posts sizable trade deficits, which are covered by tourism and other service exports, as well as significant foreign investment inflows. Between 2004 and 2013, growth averaged nearly 5% per year, led by exports. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 spurred a brief recession in Israel, but the country entered the crisis with solid fundamentals, following years of prudent fiscal policy and a resilient banking sector. Israel's economy also has weathered the Arab Spring because strong trade ties outside the Middle East have insulated the economy from spillover effects. Slowing demand domestically and internationally and reduced investment due to uncertainties caused by the Gaza conflict in summer 2014 have reduced GDP growth to about 2% during 2014. Natural gas fields discovered off Israel's coast since 2009 have brightened Israel's energy security outlook. The Tamar and Leviathan fields were some of the world's largest offshore natural gas finds this past decade. The massive Leviathan field is expected to come online no sooner than 2017, but production from Tamar provided a one percentage point boost to Israel's GDP in 2013 and a 0.5% boost in 2014. In mid-2011, public protests arose around income inequality and rising housing and commodity prices. Israel's income inequality and poverty rates are among the highest of OECD countries and there is a broad perception among the public that a small number of \"tycoons\" have a cartel-like grip over the major parts of the economy. The government formed committees and has started splitting up the oligopolies to address some of the grievances but has maintained that it will not engage in deficit spending to satisfy populist demands. Over the long term, Israel faces structural issues, including low labor participation rates for its fastest growing social segments - the ultra-orthodox and Arab-Israeli communities. Also, Israel's progressive, globally competitive, knowledge-based technology sector employs only 9% of the workforce, with the rest employed in manufacturing and services - sectors which face downward wage pressures from global competition."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$218.1 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"39"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"raw materials, military equipment, investment goods, rough diamonds, fuels, grain, consumer goods"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"2.4%","industry":"25.7%","services":"71.9% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$95.53 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"48"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, software, cut diamonds, agricultural products, chemicals, textiles and apparel"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"2.5%","highest 10%":"24.3% (2008)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Dead Sea -408 m","highest point":"Har Meron 1,208 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"31 30 N, 34 45 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"1.78 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"1.95  cu km/yr (39%/6%/55%)","per capita":"282.4  cu m/yr (2009)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling","signed, but not ratified":"Marine Life Conservation"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"limited arable land and natural freshwater resources pose serious constraints;

Israel in 2005 unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza Strip, evacuating settlers and its military while retaining control over most points of entry into the Gaza Strip. The election of HAMAS to head the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006 froze relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Israel engaged in a 34-day conflict with Hizballah in Lebanon in June-August 2006 and a 23-day conflict with HAMAS in the Gaza Strip during December 2008 and January 2009. Direct talks with the Palestinians launched in September 2010 collapsed following the expiration of Israel's 10-month partial settlement construction moratorium in the West Bank. In November 2012, Israel engaged in a seven-day conflict with HAMAS in the Gaza Strip. Direct talks with the Palestinians resumed in July 2013 but were suspended in April 2014. Three months later HAMAS and other militant groups launched rockets into Israel, which led to a 51-day conflict between Israel and militants in Gaza."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"Tel Aviv-Yafo 3.608 million; Haifa 1.097 million; JERUSALEM (capital) 839,000 (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"27.95% (male 1,151,247/female 1,098,632)","15-24 years":"15.5% (male 637,758/female 609,597)","25-54 years":"37.13% (male 1,528,271/female 1,460,772)","55-64 years":"8.57% (male 336,662/female 353,352)","65 years and over":"10.85% (male 389,401/female 483,622) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"64.1%","youth dependency ratio":"45.7%","elderly dependency ratio":"18.4%","potential support ratio":"5.4% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"NA"},"Physicians density":{"value":"3.34 physicians/1,000 population (2012)"},"Languages":{"value":"Hebrew (official), Arabic (used officially for Arab minority), English (most commonly used foreign language)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"NA"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"2.24 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"46"},"Religions":{"value":"Jewish 75%, Muslim 17.5%, Christian 2%, Druze 1.6%, other 3.9% (2013 est.)","religious affiliation":" "},"Unemployment, youth ages 15-24":{"total":"12.1%","male":"11.6%","female":"12.7% (2012 est.)","country comparison to the world":"90"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"7.2% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"68"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 0% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"25.8% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"49"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Israeli(s)","adjective":"Israeli"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"Jewish 75% (of which Israel-born 74.4%, Europe/America/Oceania-born 17.4%, Africa-born 5.1%, Asia-born 3.1%), non-Jewish 25% (mostly Arab) (2013 est.)"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"3.3 beds/1,000 population (2012)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.05 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"1.05 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.95 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.81 male(s)/female","total population":"1.01 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"39.6 years","male":"28.9 years","female":"30.2 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"8,049,314 (includes populations of the Golan Heights of Golan Sub-District and East Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel after 1967) (July 2014 est.)","note":"approximately 19,400 Israeli settlers live in the Golan Heights; approximately 200,000 Israeli settlers live in East Jerusalem (2013) (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"99"},"Birth rate":{"value":"18.48 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"96"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"5.6% of GDP (2011)","country comparison to the world":"57"},"School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)":{"total":"16 years","male":"15 years","female":"16 years (2012)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"97.8%","male":"98.7%","female":"96.8% (2011 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.68 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"72"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"NA"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"82.27 years","male":"80.43 years","female":"84.21 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"11"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"3.55 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"3.51 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"3.58 deaths/1,000 live births (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"204"},"Death rate":{"value":"5.15 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"183"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"92.1% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"1.37% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.56% (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"78"}}}
