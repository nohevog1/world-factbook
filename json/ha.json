Poverty, corruption, vulnerability to natural disasters, and low levels of education for much of the population are among Haiti's most serious impediments to economic growth. Haiti's economy suffered a severe setback in January 2010 when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake destroyed much of its capital city, Port-au-Prince, and neighboring areas. Currently the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80% of the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty, the earthquake further inflicted $7.8 billion in damage and caused the country's GDP to contract. In 2011, the Haitian economy began recovering from the earthquake. However, two hurricanes adversely affected agricultural output and the low public capital spending slowed the recovery in 2012. Two-fifths of all Haitians depend on the agricultural sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming, and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters, exacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. US economic engagement under the Caribbean Basin Trade Preference Agreement (CBTPA) and the 2008 Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE II) Act helped increase apparel exports and investment by providing duty-free access to the US. Congress voted in 2010 to extend the CBTPA and HOPE II until 2020 under the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act; the apparel sector accounts for about 90% of Haitian exports and nearly one-twentieth of GDP. Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange, equaling one-fifth of GDP and representing more than five times the earnings from exports in 2012. Haiti suffers from a lack of investment, partly because of weak infrastructure such as access to electricity. Haiti's outstanding external debt was cancelled by donor countries following the 2010 earthquake, but has since risen to $1.43 billion as of December 2014. The government relies on formal international economic assistance for fiscal sustainability, with over half of its annual budget coming from outside sources."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$NA"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"food, manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, fuels, raw materials"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"24.7%","industry":"20%","services":"55.3% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$1.431 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"152"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"apparel, manufactures, oils, cocoa, mangoes, coffee"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"0.7%","highest 10%":"47.7% (2001)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Caribbean Sea 0 m","highest point":"Chaine de la Selle 2,680 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"19 00 N, 72 25 W"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"14.03 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"1.2  cu km/yr (17%/3%/80%)","per capita":"134.3  cu m/yr (2009)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection","signed, but not ratified":"Hazardous Wastes"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"extensive deforestation (much of the remaining forested land is being cleared for agriculture and used as fuel);

In the early 17th century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola. In 1697, Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island, which later became Haiti. The French colony, based on forestry and sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean but only through the heavy importation of African slaves and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th century, Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle, Haiti became the first post-colonial black-led nation in the world, declaring its independence in 1804. Currently the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has experienced political instability for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE in February 2004, an interim government organized new elections under the auspices of the UN. Continued instability and technical delays prompted repeated postponements, but Haiti inaugurated a democratically elected president and parliament in May 2006. This was followed by contested elections in 2010 that resulted in the election of Haiti's current President, Michel MARTELLY. A massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010 with an epicenter about 25 km (15 mi) west of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Estimates are that over 300,000 people were killed and some 1.5 million left homeless. The earthquake was assessed as the worst in this region over the last 200 years."}},"People and Society":{"Major urban areas - population":{"value":"PORT-AU-PRINCE (capital) 2.44 million (2015)"},"Age structure":{"0-14 years":"33.28% (male 1,686,647/female 1,678,156)","15-24 years":"21.64% (male 1,093,024/female 1,094,591)","25-54 years":"35.78% (male 1,801,988/female 1,815,819)","55-64 years":"5.11% (male 247,588/female 269,103)","65 years and over":"4.18% (male 188,952/female 234,151) (2015 est.)","population pyramid":" "},"Dependency ratios":{"total dependency ratio":"62.3%","youth dependency ratio":"54.8%","elderly dependency ratio":"7.5%","potential support ratio":"13.3% (2015 est.)"},"HIV/AIDS - deaths":{"value":"3,800 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"40"},"Languages":{"value":"French (official), Creole (official)"},"Sanitation facility access":{"improved":"","value":"total: 72.4% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Contraceptive prevalence rate":{"value":"34.5% (2012)"},"HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS":{"value":"141,300 (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"33"},"Net migration rate":{"value":"-2.76 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"177"},"Religions":{"value":"Roman Catholic (official) 54.7%, Protestant 28.5% (Baptist 15.4%, Pentecostal 7.9%, Adventist 3%, Methodist 1.5%, other .7%), voodoo (official) 2.1%, other 4.6%, none 10.2%","note":"many Haitians practice elements of voodoo in addition to another religion, most often Roman Catholicism; voodoo was recognized as an official religion in 2003"},"Health expenditures":{"value":"9.4% of GDP (2013)","country comparison to the world":"96"},"Drinking water source":{"improved":"","value":"total: 42.3% of population (2015 est.)","unimproved":""},"Obesity - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"10.7% (2014)","country comparison to the world":"137"},"Nationality":{"noun":"Haitian(s)","adjective":"Haitian"},"Ethnic groups":{"value":"black 95%, mulatto and white 5%"},"Hospital bed density":{"value":"1.3 beds/1,000 population (2007)"},"Sex ratio":{"at birth":"1.01 male(s)/female","0-14 years":"1.01 male(s)/female","15-24 years":"1 male(s)/female","25-54 years":"0.99 male(s)/female","55-64 years":"0.92 male(s)/female","65 years and over":"0.81 male(s)/female","total population":"0.99 male(s)/female (2015 est.)"},"Median age":{"total":"22.5 years","male":"22.3 years","female":"22.7 years (2015 est.)"},"Population":{"value":"10,110,019","note":"estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected (July 2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"89"},"Birth rate":{"value":"22.31 births/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"73"},"Education expenditures":{"value":"NA"},"Children under the age of 5 years underweight":{"value":"11.6% (2012)","country comparison to the world":"64"},"Child labor - children ages 5-14":{"total number":"2,587,205","percentage":"21% (2006 est.)"},"Literacy":{"definition":"age 15 and over can read and write","total population":"60.7%","male":"64.3%","female":"57.3% (2015 est.)"},"Total fertility rate":{"value":"2.69 children born/woman (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"71"},"HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate":{"value":"1.93% (2014 est.)","country comparison to the world":"27"},"Life expectancy at birth":{"total population":"63.51 years","male":"62.07 years","female":"64.95 years (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"187"},"Infant mortality rate":{"total":"47.98 deaths/1,000 live births","male":"51.71 deaths/1,000 live births","female":"44.21 deaths/1,000 live births","note":"the preliminary 2011 numbers differ significantly from those of 2010, which were strongly influenced by the demographic effect of the January 2010 earthquake; the latest figures more closely correspond to those of 2009 (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"40"},"Death rate":{"value":"7.83 deaths/1,000 population (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"103"},"Urbanization":{"urban population":"58.6% of total population (2015)","rate of urbanization":"3.78% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)"},"Population growth rate":{"value":"1.17%","note":"the preliminary 2011 numbers differ significantly from those of 2010, which were strongly influenced by the demographic effect of the January 2010 earthquake; the latest figures more closely correspond to those of 2009 (2015 est.)","country comparison to the world":"103"},"Major infectious diseases":{"degree of risk":"high","food or waterborne diseases":"bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A and E, and typhoid fever","vectorborne diseases":"dengue fever and malaria (2013)"}}}
