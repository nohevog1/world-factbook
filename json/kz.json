It also has a large agricultural sector featuring livestock and grain. In 2002 Kazakhstan became the first country in the former Soviet Union to receive an investment-grade credit rating. Extractive industries have been and will continue to be the engine of Kazakhstan's growth, although the country is seriously pursuing diversification strategies. Kazakhstan is landlocked, with restricted access to the high seas. Although its Caspian Sea ports, pipelines, and rail lines carrying oil have been upgraded, civil aviation and roadways continue to need attention. Supply and distribution of electricity can be erratic because of regional dependencies, but the country is moving forward with plans to improve reliability of electricity and gas supply to its population. The government realizes that its economy suffers from an overreliance on oil and extractive industries. Kazakhstan has embarked on an ambitious diversification program, aimed at developing targeted sectors like transport, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, petrochemicals and food processing. In 2010 Kazakhstan joined the Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia Customs Union in an effort to boost foreign investment and improve trade relationships. The Customs Union evolved into the Eurasian Economic Union in January 2015. During 2014, Kazakhstan’s economy was hampered by Russia’s slowing economy, the weakening ruble, falling oil prices, and problems at its Kashagan oil field. Kazakhstan devalued its currency, the tenge, by 19% in February and in November the government announced a stimulus package to cope with the economic challenges."},"Market value of publicly traded shares":{"value":"$60.74 billion (31 December 2010 est.)","country comparison to the world":"61"},"Imports - commodities":{"value":"machinery and equipment, metal products, foodstuffs"},"GDP - composition, by sector of origin":{"agriculture":"4.9%","industry":"29.5%","services":"65.6% (2014 est.)"},"Debt - external":{"value":"$150.5 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","country comparison to the world":"37"},"Exports - commodities":{"value":"oil and oil products, natural gas, ferrous metals, chemicals, machinery, grain, wool, meat, coal"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":"3.9%","highest 10%":"23.7% (2011 est.)"}},"Geography":{"Elevation extremes":{"lowest point":"Vpadina Kaundy -132 m","highest point":"Khan Tangiri Shyngy (Pik Khan-Tengri) 6,995 m"},"Geographic coordinates":{"value":"48 00 N, 68 00 E"},"Total renewable water resources":{"value":"107.5 cu km (2011)"},"Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)":{"total":"21.14  cu km/yr (4%/30%/66%)","per capita":"1,304  cu m/yr (2010)"},"Environment - international agreements":{"party to":"Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands","signed, but not ratified":"Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol"},"Environment - current issues":{"value":"radioactive or toxic chemical sites associated with former defense industries and test ranges scattered throughout the country pose health risks for humans and animals;

The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th century, and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During the 1950s and 1960s agricultural \"Virgin Lands\" program, Soviet citizens were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures. This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some other deported nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-ethnic Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Non-Muslim ethnic minorities departed Kazakhstan in large numbers from the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s and a national program has repatriated about a million ethnic Kazakhs back to Kazakhstan. These trends have allowed Kazakhs to become the titular majority again. This dramatic demographic shift has also undermined the previous religious diversity and made the country more than 70 percent Muslim. Kazakhstan's economy is larger than those of all the other Central Asian states largely due to the country's vast natural resources.
